Hey everyone,

I'm proud to present something I've been working on: **Side-by-Side Blueprint** — a pure Lean port of LeanBlueprint with an integrated deployment pipeline. No Python, no external dependencies, just Lake and Lean.

This takes first steps toward some of the Lean FRO goals Leo mentioned at Lean Together 2026. The highlights:

**User-Facing Features:**
- **Side-by-side proof display** — LaTeX theorem statements paired with Lean code, toggleable proof bodies
- **Project dashboard** — Key theorems, blocked items, messages, and technical debt at a glance
- **Interactive dependency graph** — Status-colored nodes, click-through to theorems, cycle detection
- **Integrated paper generation** — Same pipeline produces blueprint, HTML paper, and PDF
- **6-tier status tracking** — From "not ready" through "mathlib-ready", auto-detected from your code
- **One-click websites** — CI action generates and deploys everything

**Example repos:**
- [Minimal test repo](https://e-vergo.github.io/SBS-Test/index.html) — Shows all features
- [GCR](https://e-vergo.github.io/General_Crystallographic_Restriction/index.html) — Complete project with blueprint + paper
- [PNT](https://e-vergo.github.io/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd/index.html) — Full-scale existing project

**Why not just use LeanBlueprint?**
- **Pure Lean** — No Python install, no version mismatches, simpler CI
- **Integrated pipeline** — Blueprint, paper, and PDF from the same build
- **Richer metadata** — Dashboard messaging, debt tracking, status progression

**Technical stack** (for the curious):
- [LeanArchitect](https://github.com/e-vergo/LeanArchitect) — General-purpose tagging system (`@[blueprint]` attribute)
- [Dress](https://github.com/e-vergo/Dress) — Extracts and "dresses" Lean with reusable assets during elaboration
- [Runway](https://github.com/e-vergo/Runway) — The LeanBlueprint port; builds blueprint, dependency graph, paper
- [dress-blueprint-action](https://github.com/e-vergo/dress-blueprint-action) — CI action for easy integration

**Caveats:** It's entirely vibe coded and not ready for prime time, but it could be with some work. Looking for feedback on what features matter most and what rough edges need smoothing first.

Happy to answer questions!

Best,
Eric
