**Terence Tao**:
> When reviewing the blueprint graph I noticed an oddity in the Erdos 392 project: the final theorems (erdos-sol-1, erdos-sol-2) were mysteriously disconnected from the rest of the Erdos 392 lemmas; and the (AI-provided) proofs were suspiciously short. After some inspection I realized the problem: I had asked to prove the (trivial) statements that n! can be factored into **at least** n-n/log n + o(n/log n) factors of size <= n, and at least n/2-n/2log n + o(n/log n) factors of size <= n^2, when in fact the Erdos problem asks to factor into **at most** n-n/log n + o(n/log n) factors of size <= n, and at most n/2-n/2log n + o(n/log n) factors of size <= n^2. (The trivial factorization n! = 1 x ... x n would satisfy the previous versions of the theorems, which is what the AI-generated proof found.)

**Eric Vergo**:
> It sounds like you were able to catch this, in part, because the dependency graph is generated using the LeanArchitect system. Maybe checking for a disconnected dependency graph can be automated and happen as the dependency graph is being generated. It would be especially useful when working towards a specific result, such as this project.

**Thomas Zhu**:
> I'm happy our LeanArchitect tool helped in this case! Indeed, this level of dependency debugging is also one of its purposes.

**Eric Vergo**:
> Awesome, I made a feature request for this.

**Pietro Monticone**:
> Cool! Thanks @Terence Tao and @Eric Vergo.
