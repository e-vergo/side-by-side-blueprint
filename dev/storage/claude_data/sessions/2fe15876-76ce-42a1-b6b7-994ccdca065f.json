Here is the analysis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Skill-by-Skill Analysis\\n\\n### 1. `/task`\\n\\n**File:** `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/.claude/skills/task/SKILL.md`\\n\\n**Does it follow the principle?** No.\\n\\n**How it currently works:** The orchestrator (top-level chat) directly executes most of the skill phases. The orchestrator runs Phase 1 (Alignment), Phase 2 (Planning), Phase 4 (Finalization), and all archive protocol transitions itself. It only delegates during Phase 3 (Execution), where it spawns `sbs-developer` agents for code changes. The orchestrator is the one managing phase transitions, gate enforcement, PR creation, issue closure, and the handoff to `/update-and-archive`.\\n\\n**Specific evidence:**\\n\\nThe \\\"Task Agent Model\\\" section (lines 489-518) describes a \\\"center stage\\\" agent but then contradicts itself by defining all phases as orchestrator-executed:\\n\\n> \\\"The `/task` invocation spawns a dedicated task agent that becomes 'center stage'\\\" (line 495)\\n\\nBut Phase 1 (line 80-103) says:\\n> \\\"This is your chance to interact with, understand and brainstorm with the user.\\\" -- addressed directly to the orchestrator, not a spawned agent.\\n\\nPhase 3 (lines 194-218) describes the orchestrator spawning agents:\\n> \\\"Execute agents sequentially (one at a time) for code changes\\\"\\n\\nPhase 4 (lines 253-283) has the orchestrator running validation and merging PRs:\\n> \\\"Run full validation suite... Merge PR via `sbs_pr_merge` MCP tool\\\"\\n\\nThe `disable-model-invocation: true` frontmatter (line 4) further confirms the orchestrator reads and executes this skill directly -- it is not delegated to a spawned agent.\\n\\n**Gap assessment:** To follow the principle, the entire `/task` workflow (alignment through finalization + handoff) should be executed by a single spawned coordination agent. The orchestrator would only spawn that agent and receive its completion report. Currently, the orchestrator is deeply involved in every phase except code execution, which contradicts the stated \\\"center stage\\\" model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. `/update-and-archive`\\n\\n**File:** `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/.claude/skills/update-and-archive/SKILL.md`\\n\\n**Does it follow the principle?** Yes.\\n\\n**How it currently works:** The skill explicitly defines a dedicated agent model. A single agent is spawned and runs autonomously through all substates (readme-wave, oracle-regen, porcelain, archive-upload). The invoking context does not orchestrate internal steps.\\n\\n**Specific evidence:**\\n\\nLines 135-173, the \\\"Agent Model\\\" section, are definitive:\\n\\n> \\\"When `/update-and-archive` is invoked, it spawns a dedicated agent that runs autonomously to completion.\\\" (line 136)\\n\\n> \\\"The update-and-archive agent: Becomes 'center stage' for the duration of the skill, Manages its own substates via archive entries, Reports completion to the invoking context, Closes the current epoch upon successful completion\\\" (lines 148-151)\\n\\n> \\\"In all cases, the u&a agent runs autonomously - the invoking context does not orchestrate its internal steps.\\\" (line 172)\\n\\nThe invocation contexts table (lines 166-171) confirms:\\n\\n> \\\"End of `/task` (Phase 5): Task agent spawns u&a agent, waits for completion\\\"\\n> \\\"Standalone invocation: Top-level spawns u&a agent directly\\\"\\n\\n**Gap assessment:** None. This skill fully follows the principle.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. `/oracle`\\n\\n**File:** `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/.claude/skills/oracle/SKILL.md`\\n\\n**Does it follow the principle?** No, but this is by design and arguably appropriate.\\n\\n**How it currently works:** The orchestrator (or whichever context invokes it) executes the skill directly. There is no agent spawning. The skill is classified as \\\"atomic\\\" -- a lightweight, single-operation query that answers a question and optionally creates an archive entry.\\n\\n**Specific evidence:**\\n\\nLines 23-28 define the archive protocol:\\n> \\\"This is an **atomic skill** (single operation, no multi-phase workflow): No global_state tracking (lightweight queries), Single archive upload on completion (optional, for tracking usage), Can run even when another skill owns global_state\\\"\\n\\nThere is no mention of spawning an agent anywhere in the file. The process section (lines 55-57) describes steps the invoking context takes directly:\\n> \\\"Parse user question to identify key concepts, Search concept index for matches, If file locations found, report with paths and brief context\\\"\\n\\n**Gap assessment:** This skill is a zero-shot Q&A lookup. Spawning a dedicated agent for a single query/response would be wasteful overhead. Whether it \\\"should\\\" follow the principle depends on whether you consider atomic skills exempt. Given the principle says \\\"the entire skill operation should be tied to the spawning and termination of a single coordination agent,\\\" strictly speaking it does not follow it. But the mismatch is a reasonable design choice given the trivial scop",

If those run inside a spawned agent, how does the user interact with that agent?\n\nLet me think about this...\n\nIn Claude Code's architecture:\n- The top-level chat is what the user interacts with\n- Spawned agents (via Task tool) run autonomously and return a result -- they don't have interactive access to the user\n\n\n- But actually, spawned agents can use AskUserQuestion directly, and those tool calls execute in the same environment, so the agent can surface questions to the user without the orchestrator relaying them\n\n. This means the orchestrator's context only grows by the spawn instruction and completion summary, while all the interaction happens within the agent's isolated context.",
