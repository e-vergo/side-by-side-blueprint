In the taxonomy session, 13/15 questions used pre-offered options; 2 used \"Other\" when pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance. In the config session, a single directive sufficed for the entire task. The user consistently favors the most comprehensive/ambitious option and communicates at high velocity.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Implication:** Alignment questions are well-calibrated. The \"Other\" escape hatch works as designed. Verbosity in confirmations is friction, not thoroughness.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192### Pattern 2: Simplicity Signals Are Strong Directives\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192In 2 of 5 sessions (40%), the user redirected Claude away from over-engineering. The pattern: user references an existing implementation -> Claude proposes alternatives -> user says \"match the existing one.\" This is a systematic tendency, not a one-off.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Implication:** Claude's design exploration instinct conflicts with user's \"match proven patterns\" preference. This needs explicit counterprogramming in agent guidance.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### Pattern 3: Agent Spawn Decision Needs Mode Awareness\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192Session 1770160373 showed the orchestrator offering agent spawn when the user was in \"doing mode\" (editing directly in VSCode). The existing rule (3+ Bash calls) wasn't sufficient -- the user's mode was signaled by direct file edits, not bash commands.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Implication:** Doing mode detection needs richer signals beyond bash call count.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192### Pattern 4: System Infrastructure Works but Doesn't Observe Itself\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192All 5 sessions had clean builds, clean gate checks, successful PR workflows, and atomic skill handoffs. The infrastructure is reliable. However, the observation layer (tags, quality scores) is broken -- tags don't discriminate and quality scores cover only 3% of entries. The system works but can't measure how well it works.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192---\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**L1 observations:** User communication is efficient, alignment questions work well, finalization can be faster. Doing mode detection failed once.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries), 81 issue-driven vs 74 freeform tasks. No interruptions in 84/85 sessions.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Synthesis:** The user-facing interaction model is mature. The remaining friction is at the margins: verbose finalization confirmations and a single doing mode detection failure. Two issues logged (#113 doing mode, #116 verbose finalization).\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval rate, zero backward transitions. One session (taxonomy) executed 13 commits across 3 waves with zero regressions. Execution quality is high when aligned.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192**MCP findings:** 85% task completion rate. Finalization is the most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped.\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192**Synthesis:** Execution quality is strong but completion rate has room to improve. The 15% incompletion likely stems from context compaction in long sessions disrupting the finalization ceremony. One investigation issue logged (#114).\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192**L1 observations:** Over-engineering in 2/5 sessions when user had clear pattern reference. 100% plan approval on first presentation.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192**MCP findings:** 29/29 plans reached execution (100% approval). Zero backward transitions.\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192**Synthesis:** Alignment succeeds structurally (plans always approved) but Claude's tendency to explore design space creates friction when the user wants simplicity ma",

Two remaining issues (#111, #114) are investigations requiring deeper work.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192---\n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192### Pattern 1: Observation Layer Remains the Weakest Link\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192Despite closing #110, the tag system still produces zero discriminatory signal. All 83 tags have signal_score 0.0. The per-session scoping fix prevented cross-session leakage but didn't address the fundamental problem: rules fire uniformly across all sessions. Quality score coverage remains at 3.2%. The system works reliably but cannot measure how well it works. This was the top finding in L2 cycle 1 and remains the top finding in cycle 2.\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Trend:** Persistent. Two cycles, same core issue. #121 reopens this with a focus on rule discrimination rather than scope leakage.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Coordination Maturing but Has Blind Spots\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192The MVP session (8 agents, 4 waves) and triage session (6 agents, 3 waves) both executed cleanly with zero file collisions and no backward transitions. Parallelism mechanics are solid. However, exploration-phase parallelism has a quality gap: multiple agents independently confirm the same fact instead of dividing investigation dimensions.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Not visible in cycle 1 because previous sessions used fewer exploration agents.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192### Pattern 3: Tool Trust Requires Qualification\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192The MCP module caching issue (retrospective 1770174216) introduced a new category of system friction: tool output diverging from ground truth due to stale process state. This is distinct from previous tool issues (missing capabilities, wrong thresholds) -- it's a reliability hazard where the tool appears to work but returns stale data.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Specific to sessions where Python source is edited and then validated via MCP.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192### Pattern 4: Meta-Recursion Accelerates Improvement\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192The triage session (#120) implemented fixes from the previous self-improve cycle (#112, #113, #115, #116) and immediately validated two of them within the same session. #116 (compressed finalization) was used successfully at the session's end. This demonstrates a healthy feedback loop where self-improve findings translate to actionable fixes that are exercised in subsequent sessions.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192---\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**L1 observations:** User continues to be decisive and efficient. Compressed finalization (#116) validated. Triage alignment: 0.2 questions per issue. Visual review during planning surfaces concrete requirements.\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 85 issue-driven, 78 freeform tasks. 1 interruption in 90 sessions.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Synthesis:** User interaction is stable and efficient. The main improvement opportunity is structural: documenting triage wave patterns (#127) so future sessions benefit from the efficient structure observed in 1770174216. No regressions from cycle 1.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192**L1 observations:** Exploration redundancy (4 agents on same question).

Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:\n    43\u2192- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    44\u2192- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192The crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:\n    53\u2192- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%\n    54\u2192- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)\n    55\u2192- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)\n    56\u2192- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192The exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192The MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:\n    63\u21921. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning\n    64\u21922. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192This is distinct from the \"simplicity matching\" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192Three cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero impro",

These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192---\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192Cycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192This is the same \"closure != resolution\" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192Two `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3.

The process is maturing.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192Quality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags).

Tags like `signal:retry-loop` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate. This has been true for multiple cycles but this is the first time a retrospective explicitly flagged it as misleading (\"over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns\").\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The tag system currently serves as a session classifier, not an entry classifier. This distinction hasn't been articulated before.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Crush Mode is a Mature, Reliable Pattern\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192Two consecutive sessions (#155 feature task, then crush) both executed cleanly with no retries, no collisions, and 100% plan approval. The crush specifically: 8 issues, 5 waves, 8 agents, 0 corrections. The triage-table presentation format enables fast approval. Crush mode has crossed from \"experimental\" to \"standard operating procedure.\"\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 3: Guidance Verification Debt is Compounding\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192| Cycle | Guidance additions | Verified |\n    57\u2192|-------|-------------------|----------|\n    58\u2192| 2 | ~5 | 2 |\n    59\u2192| 3 | ~5 | 0 |\n    60\u2192| 4 | 3 | 0 |\n    61\u2192| 5 (crush closures) | 8 | 0 |\n    62\u2192| **Total** | **~21** | **2** |\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192This is the most concerning cross-session pattern. 90%+ of guidance additions remain unverified. The self-improve cycle creates recommendations, which get closed via code/doc changes, but there's no feedback loop confirming behavioral change. Issue #164 addresses this.\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pattern 4: Execution Metrics Continue Stable\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192| Metric | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Cycle 5 |\n    69\u2192|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n    70\u2192| Task completion | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% |\n    71\u2192| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n    72\u2192| Gate failures | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 |\n    73\u2192| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n    74\u2192| Interruption rate | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 |\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192All operational metrics are stable or improving slightly.

After 5 L2 cycles analyzing 14 retrospectives and 27 issues, task completion remains stable (85-88%), but quality coverage (3.0-3.2%) and tag signal (0.0%) are unmoved. The most significant meta-pattern: **guidance accumulation without verification** is creating documentation debt that undermines the introspection system's core purpose.\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192The convergence achievement (98.9% QA pass on first try) demonstrates the system's execution capability has matured. The plateau at unfixable failure shows proper issue categorization. But persistent measurement gaps reveal structural limitations in how the system observes itself.\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192---\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192## Cross-Cycle Patterns (by significance)\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192### 1. Measurement Instrumentation Gap (Structural)\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Pattern:** Quality coverage and tag signal remain at ~3% and 0.0% across all cycles despite multiple architectural interventions.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192**Evidence:**\n    24\u2192- C1: Quality 3.2%, tags 0.0 \u2192 identified observation layer broken\n    25\u2192- C2: Quality 3.2%, tags 0.0 \u2192 71% issue closure, problems persist\n    26\u2192- C3: Quality 3.1%, tags 0.0 \u2192 architectural redirect to DuckDB\n    27\u2192- C4: Quality 3.1% \u2192 architectural intervention not yet effective\n    28\u2192- C5: Quality 3.0%, tags 0.0 \u2192 auto-tags misunderstood as entry-level\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Diagnosis:** The system cannot observe what it's optimizing. Issue closure is efficient (100% in C2/C4) but doesn't address root causes. This is not tactical (fixable by more issues) but structural (requires instrumentation redesign).\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Meta-observation:** L2 cycles identify the problem repeatedly but cannot fix it because the fix requires capabilities outside the L2 scope. This is a **hierarchy boundary collision** -- L2 discovers L4-level engineering work.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192---\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### 2. Guidance Verification Debt (Compounding)\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192**Pattern:** Documentation additions (~21 items C1-C4) vastly outpace verification (~4 verified by C5).\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Evidence:**\n    41\u2192- C1: 7 guidance additions from retrospectives\n    42\u2192- C2: Additional patterns documented, no verification count\n    43\u2192- C3: \"Known docs not consulted\" finding \u2192 suggests unused guidance\n    44\u2192- C4: Explicit finding \"Guidance accumulates without verification (~21 additions, 2 verified)\"\n    45\u2192- C5: Debt acknowledged as compounding (~21 additions, ~4 verified)\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Diagnosis:** The introspection loop produces insights faster than the execution loop validates them. Unverified guidance creates three risks:\n    48\u21921. **False confidence:** Assume problems are solved because guidance exists\n    49\u21922. **Noise accumulation:** Good and bad advice indistinguishable\n    50\u21923. **Search burden:** More docs = harder to find relevant patterns\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**Meta-observation:** This is a **feedback loop design flaw**. L2 closes the discovery\u2192documentation loop but lacks a validation\u2192pruning loop. Without pruning, the system's knowledge base degrades over time.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192---\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192### 3. Execution Stability vs Insight Depth (Diverging)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192**Pattern:** Operational metrics (task completion, plan approval, gate failures) are stable/excellent while insight metrics (issues logged, finding depth) show volatile evolution.\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**Evidence:**\n    61\u2192- **Stable:** Task completion 85-88%, plan approval 100%, backward transitions 0, gate failures 0\n    62\u2192- **Volatile:** Issues logged per cycle: 7\u21927\u21928\u21923\u21925 (coefficient of variation ~35%)\n    63\u2192- **Qualitative shift:** C1 \"simplicity signals\" \u2192 C3 \"closure \u2260 resolution\" \u2192 C5 \"auto-tags session-level\"\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**Convergence validation:** GCR 98.9% pass on first evaluation confirms execution maturity. Single unfixable failure properly categorized (Dress limitation, not CSS/JS).\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**Diagnosis:** The system is **operationally excellent but epistemically uncertain**. Execution works reliably; understanding why it works (or doesn't) remains exploratory. The drop from 8\u21923 issues in C4 followed by rebound to 5 in C5 suggests L2 hasn't converged on stable introspection criteria.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Meta-observation:** This divergence is expected for a maturing system. Early cycles focus on execution bugs (high issue count); later cycles focus on understanding (deeper findings, fewer issues). The C4 drop may indicate overcorrection or discovery exhaustion rather than maturity.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192---\n",

While GCR had a single unfixable criterion (Dress limitation on one feature), SBSTest exposes a **fundamental pipeline gap**: the Dress artifact generation doesn't produce per-declaration HTML/hover files, causing 11 of 16 failures. This is not a missing feature -- the code in `SBSBlueprint/Render.lean` expects these files and falls back to `-- See: X` reference comments when they don't exist.\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192Combined with the previous GCR L3 finding of \"operational excellence with epistemic stagnation,\" SBSTest adds: **execution infrastructure has known architectural gaps that QA now surfaces reliably**.\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192---\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192## Cross-Project Convergence Comparison\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192| Dimension | GCR | SBSTest |\n    20\u2192|-----------|-----|---------|\n    21\u2192| Initial pass rate | 98.9% | 83.8% |\n    22\u2192| Final pass rate | 98.9% (plateau) | 85.9% (plateau) |\n    23\u2192| Iterations to plateau | 1 | 2 |\n    24\u2192| CSS/JS-fixable failures | 0 | 2 (zebra striping) |\n    25\u2192| Structural failures | 1 (Dress limitation) | 14 (pipeline + content) |\n    26\u2192| Issues logged | 0 | 1 (#184) |\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Key insight:** GCR's near-perfect score masked the Dress artifact issue because GCR likely has artifact files generated by an earlier build pipeline version or different configuration. SBSTest, as the minimal test project, exposes the pipeline gap more acutely.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192---\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192## Structural Findings\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192### 1. Dress Artifact Pipeline Gap (Critical, Issue #184)\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192The core side-by-side feature -- displaying formal Lean proofs alongside LaTeX statements -- is functionally broken for SBSTest. The `renderLeanColumn` function in `SBSBlueprint/Render.lean` has a well-defined artifact loading path (`loadArtifact` -> `decl.html` + `decl.hovers.json`) that falls through to reference comments for every declaration.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192This affects:\n    39\u2192- Rainbow bracket highlighting (7 criteria)\n    40\u2192- Hover tooltips (1 criterion)\n    41\u2192- Tactic state toggles (1 criterion)\n    42\u2192- Node modal content depth (1 criterion)\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192**Relationship to L2 findings:** This is a direct instance of the \"execution maturity vs measurement stagnation\" pattern from the GCR L3. The build pipeline executes successfully (no errors), but the output is incomplete.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192### 2. Paper TeX Content Scope (Medium, 4 criteria)\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192SBSTest's paper uses a status badge demonstration format without math, :::leanStatement, :::leanProof, or :::sideBySide hooks. These QA criteria assume a feature-complete paper. The criteria are valid for production projects (GCR uses them) but SBSTest's paper is intentionally minimal.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192**Recommendation:** Either enrich SBSTest's paper with these features or scope criteria by project.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192### 3. CSS Selector Architecture (Resolved)\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192The zebra striping fix required two iterations:\n    55\u21921. First attempt: `.sbs-container:nth-child(even of .sbs-container)` -- failed because sbs-containers are NOT siblings (each lives in its own `<section>`)\n    56\u21922. Corrected: `section:has(.sbs-container):nth-child(even of section:has(.sbs-container))` -- works because sections ARE siblings within `.chapter-page`\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192This exposed a gap in the fix agent's architectural understanding: DOM structure assumptions were wrong. The agent correctly used CSS4 selectors but applied them to the wrong structural level.\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192---\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192## Convergence Process Observations\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192### Loop Efficiency\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192The convergence loop correctly:\n    67\u2192- Identified 16 failures across 5 page types\n    68\u2192- Categorized 14 as unfixable in CSS/JS scope\n    69\u2192- Fixed the 2 fixable items (zebra striping)\n    70\u2192- Logged the pipeline issue proactively (#184)\n    71\u2192- Detected plateau after 1 fix iteration\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192The loop exited at the right time. Continuing to iteration 3 would have produced identical results.\n    74\u2192\n    75\u2192### Fix Agent DOM Understanding\n    76\u2192\n    77\u2192The initial CSS fix failed because the fix agent assumed `.sbs-container` elements were siblings. The DOM structure (each container in a separate `<section>`) was not queried before writing the selector. This is the same \"explore before acting\" pattern identified in L2 cycle 4 (#152).\n    78\u2192\n    79\u2192---\n    80\u2192\n    81\u2192## Relationship to Previous L3 (GCR)\n    82\u2192\n    83\u2192The GCR L3 identified five cross-cycle patterns.

Skill Evolution Trajectory\n\nThe L2 self-improvement system has evolved through three distinct phases across 5 cycles:\n\n### Phase 1: Discovery (C1-C2)\n- Identifying surface patterns (\"simplicity signals\", \"doing mode detection\")\n- Basic metrics collection (quality 3.2%, tags 0.0)\n- High issue count (7+7 = 14 issues in 2 cycles)\n- Process improvements dominate findings\n\n### Phase 2: Recognition (C3)\n- Critical meta-insight: \"closure \u2260 resolution\"\n- Observation layer debt identified as structural, not incremental\n- Explicit redirection from incremental fixes to architectural solutions (DuckDB for tags, build pipeline for quality)\n- Shift from \"fix what exists\" to \"replace what doesn't work\"\n\n### Phase 3: Refinement (C4-C5)\n- Finding depth increases, count decreases (3\u21925 vs. previous 7-8)\n- Guidance verification debt quantified (~21 additions, ~4 verified)\n- Improvement capture tool adopted (3 uses across C4-C5)\n- Batched dialogue phase validated (reduced from 1688s to single-batch review)\n- System stabilizing: fewer novel problems, deeper analysis\n\n### Trajectory Assessment\n\nThe system is learning to distinguish implementation problems (fixable with code) from architectural problems (requiring redesign). This is healthy maturation.\n\n**Finding categories evolution:**\n```\nC1: \"we don't know X\", \"we can't measure Y\"\nC2: \"the fix for X didn't go far enough\"\nC3: \"incremental fixes don't work for X, need structural change\"\nC4: \"we're creating unverified guidance faster than we validate it\"\nC5: \"auto-tags are session-level, not entry-level\" (architectural clarity)\n```\n\n**Key trend:** The system is maturing from discovery to architectural recognition. However, it's accumulating unverified guidance faster than it can validate behavioral change - a new form of technical debt.\n\n**Meta-observation:** L2 cycles produce insights faster than execution validates them. This creates a feedback loop design flaw: L2 closes the discovery\u2192documentation loop but lacks a validation\u2192pruning loop.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Recurring Friction Inventory\n\nProblems appearing in 3+ L2 documents despite being \"addressed\":\n\n### Auto-Tag Discrimination (All 5 cycles)\n\n**Persistence pattern:**\n- **C1:** Tags fire uniformly (73% entries), 0.0 signal score \u2192 #110 logged\n- **C2:** Per-session scoping added (#110 closed), tags still 0.0 signal \u2192 #121 logged\n- **C3:** Rules redesigned (#121 closed), tags STILL 0.0 signal \u2192 #138 defers to DuckDB\n- **C4:** Acknowledged as architectural, not fixable incrementally\n- **C5:** Identified as session-level not entry-level \u2192 #160 logged\n\n**What persistence reveals:** Rule-based tag classification is the wrong abstraction. Five cycles of incremental fixes produced zero metric improvement. The system now recognizes this and has redirected to DuckDB architectural solution, but that solution hasn't been implemented.\n\n**Intervention types attempted:** Code fixes (#110, #121), architectural redirect (#138), architectural clarification (#160)\n\n**Resolution strategy:** Tags remain at 0.0 signal. DuckDB path (#118, #138) is designated fix but unimplemented for 3 cycles. Further incremental fixes are futile.\n\n---\n\n### Quality Score Coverage (All 5 cycles)\n\n**Persistence pattern:**\n- **C1:** 3.2% coverage, identified as high-impact gap \u2192 #111 logged\n- **C2:** 3.2% unchanged, investigated but deferred\n- **C3:** 3.1% unchanged despite 100% closure of related issues\n- **C4:** 3.1% unchanged \u2192 #143 (build integration) logged\n- **C5:** 3.0% unchanged, #143 closed but unverified\n\n**What persistence reveals:** Standalone tooling is the wrong delivery mechanism. The fix (#143 build pipeline integration) was closed in C5 but hasn't been exercised via build yet, so metric remains unmoved. This is another instance of \"closure \u2260 resolution.\"\n\n**Intervention types attempted:** Investigation (#111), architectural redirect (#143)\n\n**Resolution strategy:** Quality score integration into build.py implemented but unverified. A single build run should verify whether coverage jumps to >30%. Until that build occurs, the 5-cycle stagnation continues.\n\n---\n\n### Guidance Verification Gap (C3-C5)\n\n**Persistence pattern:**\n- **C3:** Known docs not consulted despite being in CLAUDE.md \u2192 #136, #137 logged\n- **C4:** Explicit finding \"~14 guidance additions, 2 verified\"\n- **C5:** Debt compounding \"~21 additions, ~4 verified\" \u2192 #164 logged for protocol\n\n**What persistence reveals:** The L2 loop produces insights \u2192 documentation faster than execution validates them. This creates:\n1. **False confidence:** Assume problems solved because guidance exists\n2. **Noise accumulation:** Good and bad advice indistinguishable\n3. **Search burden:** More docs = harder to find relevant patterns\n\n**Intervention types attempted:** Guidance additions (12+ items), protocol definition (#164)\n\n**Resolution strategy:** Issue #164 establishes verification protocol, but it's been logged not implemented. The gap will continue compounding until L2 cycles include verification sampling (already defined in SKILL.md but unused in C1-C5).\n\n---\n\n### Finalization as Most Common Failure Substate (C2-C5)\n\n**Persistence pattern:**\n- Mentioned in C2, C3, C4, C5 MCP findings as most common failure substate\n- 85-88% task completion means 12-15% incompletion, concentrated in finalization\n- **C1 hypothesis:** Context compaction in long sessions disrupts ceremony\n- **No verification:** Never investigated deeper despite recurring across 4 cycles\n\n**What persistence reveals:** This may be a measurement artifact (finalization is the last phase, so failures elsewhere still show as \"didn't reach finalization\") or genuine pattern. Four cycles of observation without investigation suggests it's accepted as background noise rather than actionable friction.\n\n**Intervention types attempted:** None\n\n**Resolution strategy:** Needs investigation. Use `sbs_search_entries` to find finalization entries with failure signals and classify modes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Metric Trajectory Analysis\n\nQuantitative metrics extracted from all L2 documents:\n\n| Metric | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | Trend |\n|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| **Task completion** | 85% | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% | \u2197 Improving |\n| **Plan approval rate** | 100% (29/29) | 100% (30/30) | 100% (31/31) | 100% (31/31) | 100% (33/33) | \u2713 Stable |\n| **Backward transitions** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \u2713 Stable |\n| **Gate failures** | 0/24 | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 | \u2713 Stable |\n| **Interruption rate** | 1/85 | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 | \u2713 Stable |\n| **Quality coverage** | 3.2% | 3.2% | 3.1% | 3.1% | 3.0% | \u2194 Stagnant |\n| **Tag signal score** | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | \u2194 Stagnant |\n| **Issues logged** | 7 | 7 | 8 | 3 | 5 | \u2193 Decreasing |\n| **Closure rate (prev cycle)** | - | 71% (5/7) | 100% (7/7) | 75% (6/8) | 100% (5/5) | \u2197 Improving |\n| **Guidance verified** | 2/7 | ? | ~2/15 | ~2/16 | ~4/21 | \u2194 Lagging |\n\n### Plateaus\n- **Plan approval:** 100% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached\n- **Gate failures:** 0% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached\n- **Backward transitions:** 0% since C1 - cannot improve further, structural ceiling reached\n- **Quality coverage:** Stuck at ~3% for all 5 cycles - architectural intervention pending\n- **Tag signal:** Stuck at 0.0 for all 5 cycles - architectural intervention pending\n\n### Improvements\n- **Task completion:** 85% \u2192 87.8% (+2.8pp over 5 cycles, +0.56pp per cycle avg)\n  - Linear trend suggests approaching plateau around 90%\n- **Closure rate:** 71% \u2192 100% (but C3 identified this as misleading metric)\n- **Interruption rate:** Stable at ~2/109 (1.8%, excellent)\n\n### Regressions\n- **None in operational metrics** - system is stable\n- **Issues logged decreasing:** 7\u21925 reflects maturation (fewer novel problems) not deterioration\n\n### Stuck Areas\n- **Quality coverage and tag signal:** Structural issues requiring architectural intervention (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags)\n- **Guidance verification:** Process gap requiring new validation loop (#164)\n\n### Directional Indicators\n\n**Accelerating:** None (all operational metrics plateaued at excellence)\n**Stable/Improving:** Task completion (+0.56pp/cycle), closure efficiency (100%)\n**Stagnant:** Quality coverage (3.0%), tag signal (0.0), guidance verification (20%)\n**Deteriorating:** None\n\n**Overall assessment:** Operational metrics have plateaued at excellence. Improvement opportunity now concentrated in measurement/observation infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Intervention Effectiveness\n\nClassifying 30 issues logged across C1-C5 by type and tracking resolution:\n\n### By Intervention Type\n\n| Type | Count | Examples | Closure Rate |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|\n| **Guidance addition** | 14 | #112 (simplicity), #113 (doing mode), #127 (triage), #136 (pre-flight), #137 (consult docs), #139 (quantitative), #140 (taxonomy tests), #152 (explore-before-ask), #164 (verification) | 86% (12/14) |\n| **Code fix** | 6 | #115 (T6 threshold), #123 (MCP caching), #126 (question_stats), #141 (boundary), #153 (serve errors), #161 (gh CLI) | 100% (6/6) |\n| **Investigation** | 3 | #114 (task incompletion), #142 (improvement_capture), #162 (test simulation) | 100% (3/3) |\n| **Architectural redirect** | 4 | #110\u2192#121\u2192#138 (tags to DuckDB), #111\u2192#143 (quality to build), #160 (tag granularity) | 50% (2/4) |\n| **Protocol definition** | 3 | #116 (compress finalization), #154 (metric verification), #164 (guidance verification) | 67% (2/3) |\n\n### Resolution vs Outcome\n\n| Type | Closed | Verified | Resolution % | Outcome % |\n|------|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Code fix** | 6/6 (100%) | ~5/6 (83%) | 100% | 83% |\n| **Guidance addition** | 12/14 (86%) | ~2/14 (14%) | 86% | 14% |\n| **Investigation** | 3/3 (100%) | 1/3 (33%) | 100% | 33% |\n| **Architectural redirect** | 2/4 (50%) | 0/4 (0%) | 50% | 0% |\n| **Protocol definition** | 2/3 (67%) | 1/3 (33%) | 67% | 33% |\n\n### Which Intervention Types Produce Verifiable Results\n\n#### Effective (High Outcome %)\n- **Code fixes:** #115 T6 threshold, #123 MCP caching, #126 question_stats - closed and verified in subsequent sessions\n- **Guidance with immediate validation:** #127 triage waves verified in C2 crush, #116 compressed finalization verified in C2 triage\n\n#### Ineffective (Low Outcome %)\n- **Guidance without validation opportunity:** ~12 additions across C2-C5, unverified\n- **Architectural interventions:** Tags/quality still at 0.0/3.0% after 5 cycles despite multiple redirects\n\n### Closure Timeline\n\n| Issues Logged | Cycle Logged | Closure Cycle | Lag (Cycles) |\n|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| #110-116 (C1) | C1 | C2 (5/7), C3 (2/7) | 1-2 |\n| #121-127 (C2) | C2 | C3 (7/7) | 1 |\n| #136-143 (C3) | C3 | C4 (6/8), C5 (2/8) | 1-2 |\n| #152-154 (C4) | C4 | C5 (5/5) | 1 |\n| #160-164 (C5) | C5 | Pending | - |\n\n**Average closure lag:** 1.2 cycles (very efficient)\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Code fixes are most effective:** 100% closure, 83% verification. When the fix is code, it works.\n2. **Guidance additions are efficient but unverified:** 86% closure, 14% verification. Easy to close (add text to SKILL.md), hard to validate (requires future sessions).\n3. **Architectural interventions are pending:** 50% closure, 0% verification. These require engineering work outside L2 scope.\n4. **Closure efficiency is misleading:** High closure rates (71% \u2192 100%) don't correlate with problem resolution (quality/tags unmoved).\n\n**Conclusion:** The system is efficient at closing issues but inefficient at verifying outcomes. Interventions that can be validated immediately (code fixes, guidance used in same cycle) succeed. Interventions requiring future sessions to validate (most guidance) accumulate as debt.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Observation Layer Meta-Assessment\n\nIs the improvement system observing the right things?\n\n### Coverage Gaps: What ISN'T Being Measured\n\n**What IS being measured:**\n- Task completion, plan approval, gate failures, backward transitions (all operational metrics)\n- Issue count, closure rate (process metrics)\n- Retrospective narratives (qualitative, high-fidelity but not aggregatable)\n\n**What ISN'T being measured:**\n- **Guidance adoption rate:** No tool to scan sessions for prescribed behaviors\n- **Problem resolution vs issue closure:** Metrics don't track outcome, only process\n- **Entry-level characteristics:** Tags are session-level, quality scores sparse (3%)\n- **Cross-session learning transfer:** No metric for pattern reuse\n- **User satisfaction:** Inferred from interruption rate, not measured directly\n- **Artifact completeness:** Builds succeed but output may be incomplete (no check for decl.html/decl.hovers.json)\n\n**Most critical gap:** Outcome metrics. The system tracks whether work was done (issues closed, builds passed) but not whether problems were solved (quality improved, tags discriminate, users benefited).\n\n### False Confidence: Metrics That Look Good But Miss Reality\n\n#### 1. 100% Closure Rate (C2, C4)\n**What it shows:** All issues from previous cycle were closed\n**What it misses:** Quality/tags unmoved despite closing #110, #111, #121\n**Why it's misleading:** Closing an issue means code/docs changed, not that the problem was solved\n\n#### 2. 100% Plan Approval\n**What it shows:** All plans approved on first attempt\n**What it misses:** C3 found agents don't read Known Limitations before planning (2 rejections in MVP session)\n**Why it's misleading:** Plans are approved because they sound reasonable, not because they incorporate all constraints\n\n#### 3. 0% Gate Failures\n**What it shows:** All builds pass quality gates\n**What it misses:** Gates don't check artifact completeness, guidance adoption, or whether features actually work\n**Why it's misleading:** Passing gates means no regressions, not that new work is correct\n\n#### 4. Improvement Capture Adoption (3 uses across C4-C5)\n**What it shows:** Tool is being used\n**What it misses:** Low usage rate (3 in 2 cycles, ~6 sessions) suggests friction or missed opportunities\n**Why it's misleading:** Tool existence \u2260 tool utility\n\n**Root cause:** Process metrics (did we complete the activity?) dominate outcome metrics (did the activity achieve its purpose?).\n\n### Signal-to-Noise: Are Findings Getting More Actionable Over Time?\n\n| Cycle | Avg Severity | Specificity | Actionability |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|---------------|\n| C1 | Medium | General patterns | High (7/7 addressable) |\n| C2 | Medium | Refinements | High (7/7 addressable) |\n| C3 | High | Architectural recognition | Medium (5/8 guidance, 3/8 structural) |\n| C4 | High | Meta-process | High (3/3 but verification needed) |\n| C5 | High | Precision gaps | Medium (2/5 architectural, 3/5 guidance) |\n\n**Trend:** Findings are getting deeper (architectural vs tactical) and more precise (specific anti-patterns vs general \"do better\").\n\n**Signal quality improving:** Yes. Finding depth progression:\n```\nC1: \"Doing mode detection needs richer signals\"\nC2: \"Exploration agents need task differentiation\"\nC3: \"Observation layer debt is structural, not incremental\"\nC4: \"Guidance accumulates without verification\"\nC5: \"Auto-tags are session-level, not entry-level\"\n```\n\n**Noise sources:**\n- **Unverified guidance additions:** 14/14 guidance items in C2-C4 have unknown adoption\n- **Re-logged architectural issues:** #110\u2192#121\u2192#138 for tags (same problem, different issue numbers)\n- **Finalization failures:** Noted in 4 cycles but never investigated (signal or noise?)\n\n**Overall assessment:** Signal quality is improving, but action pipeline is bottlenecked on verification and architectural work. High-quality findings accumulate without resolution.\n\n### Assessment: Is the System Observing the Right Things?\n\n**No, with caveats.**\n\nThe system observes operational execution well (completion, approvals, gates) but observes outcomes poorly (quality, tags, guidance adoption). This creates Goodhart's Law risk: optimizing process metrics that don't correlate with actual improvement.\n\n**However:** The L2 system has recognized this gap and explicitly logged it:\n- #154 (metric verification in finalization)\n- #164 (guidance verification protocol)\n- #160 (tag granularity for better discrimination)\n\nThe observation layer is **observing its own inadequacy**, which is meta-progress. The system knows what it doesn't know.\n\n**Critical next step:** Shift measurement from process (closure, completion) to outcome (quality >30%, tags >0.1, guidance adoption >50%). Block additional L2 cycles until outcome instrumentation exists, otherwise introspection optimizes the wrong target.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Recommendations for Next L3 Cycle\n\n### A. Implement Outcome Metrics Before Next L2 (Critical)\n\n**Context:** Five L2 cycles have produced 31 issues, 26 closed, but quality/tags unmoved. Process metrics (closure) are misleading.\n\n**Action:** Define measurable outcomes and track alongside process metrics:\n- **Quality coverage target:** 80% (currently 3%)\n- **Tag signal target:** >0.5 precision/recall (currently 0.0)\n- **Guidance adoption target:** >50% (currently ~20%)\n\n**Enforcement:** Block additional L2 cycles if outcome metrics don't improve across 2 cycles. This indicates logging theater (appearance of progress without actual improvement).\n\n**Why this matters:** Without outcome metrics, introspection optimizes the wrong target (closure efficiency vs actual improvement). Current pattern: high closure rates (100%) correlate with zero outcome improvement (quality/tags unchanged).\n\n**Implementation path:** Add outcome tracking to L2 archive phase. Report \"Outcome Delta\" alongside \"Issues Logged/Closed.\"\n\n---\n\n### B. Execute Architectural Interventions (#143, DuckDB) (Critical)\n\n**Context:** Tags and quality have been \"deferred to architectural solutions\" for 3+ cycles, but those solutions haven't been implemented.\n\n**Action:** Dedicate focused /task cycles to:\n1. **#143:** Quality validator integration in build.py (closed but unverified)\n2. **DuckDB schema:** Entry-level tag extraction (#118, #138, #160)\n3. **Verification build:** Run a build and confirm quality coverage >30%\n\n**Why this matters:** L2 cycles cannot progress meaningfully while foundational measurement tools are broken. Current pattern (diagnose \u2192 log \u2192 no change \u2192 re-diagnose) is waste.\n\n**Timeline:** Measurement instrumentation blocks meaningful introspection progress. Prioritize this over additional L2 cycles until quality >30% and tags >0.1 signal score.\n\n---\n\n### C. Add Verification Sampling to L2 Discovery (High)\n\n**Context:** ~21 guidance additions, ~4 verified (19% verification rate). Documentation debt compounding.\n\n**Action:** Implement Step 0.5 verification sampling in L2 discovery phase (already defined in SKILL.md but unused in C1-C5):\n1. Pick 2-3 prior guidance items (from previous cycles)\n2. Search session JSONL files for behavioral evidence\n3. Classify as ADOPTED / NOT YET OBSERVED / INEFFECTIVE\n4. Escalate items hitting 2-cycle \"NOT YET OBSERVED\" threshold to INEFFECTIVE\n5. Recommend strengthening, removing, or automating ineffective guidance\n\n**Why this matters:** Prevents knowledge base degradation and false confidence. Guidance additions are cheap (add text to SKILL.md); verification is the bottleneck. Without pruning, the system's knowledge base degrades over time.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Verification rate >50% within 2 cycles, ineffective guidance pruned.\n\n---\n\n### D. Investigate Finalization Failure Pattern (Medium)\n\n**Context:** Finalization noted as most common failure substate in C2-C5, never investigated deeper.\n\n**Action:** In next L2 cycle, use `sbs_search_entries` to:\n1. Find entries with `substate: \"finalization\"` and failure signals in `notes`\n2. Classify failure modes (context compaction, gate failures, user cancellation, other)\n3. Log investigation findings as new issue or update existing #114\n\n**Why this matters:** Four cycles of observation without action suggests this may be measurement artifact (finalization is last phase, so all failures appear here) or accepted background noise. Explicit investigation closes the loop.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Either confirm it's measurement artifact and stop tracking, or identify root cause and address.\n\n---\n\n### E. Track Improvement Capture Adoption Trend (Low)\n\n**Context:** `sbs_improvement_capture` used 3 times across C4-C5. This validates zero-friction capture workflow, but usage rate is low.\n\n**Action:** In next L3 cycle, count improvement captures between L2 cycles. Trend data becomes meaningful after 3+ capture cycles. If usage drops to 0 for 2 consecutive L2 cycles, investigate:\n- Is there friction in the capture workflow?\n- Are opportunities being missed?\n- Is the tool providing value?\n\n**Why this matters:** Improvement captures are early-warning signals for friction that retrospectives miss (observations logged mid-session, not post-session). Low adoption means missed insights.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Usage trend visible (increasing, stable, or declining). If declining, diagnose and fix or deprecate tool.\n\n---\n\n### F. Test Data-Based Hypotheses (Medium)\n\nGiven the Data Speaks section, actively test these hypotheses in the next L3 cycle:\n\n#### Hypothesis 1: System Engineering Bias\n**Claim:** 48% of issues are System Engineering pillar. Is this because system tooling is genuinely weaker, or because system issues are easier to observe/log than user/alignment issues?\n\n**Test method:** In next L3, classify C6+ issues. If System pillar drops below 30%, the bias was early-stage discovery. If it stays at 45%+, system tooling is genuinely the weakest area.\n\n#### Hypothesis 2: Closure Lag Variance\n**Claim:** C2 issues closed in 1 cycle (100%), C1/C3 took 1-2 cycles (71%\u2192100% and 75%\u2192100%). What determines fast vs slow closure?\n\n**Test method:** Correlate closure lag with issue type (code fix, guidance, architectural). Hypothesis: code fixes close faster, architectural issues slower.\n\n#### Hypothesis 3: Verification Bottleneck\n**Claim:** 23% verification rate. Is this because guidance is wrong, or because validation opportunities are rare?\n\n**Test method:** For C5 issues, track how many subsequent sessions provide validation opportunities (e.g., #152 explore-before-ask needs alignment-phase sessions). If opportunities exist but verification doesn't happen, guidance is likely ineffective. If opportunities are rare, verification process is sound but slow.\n\n**Why this matters:** Moving from observation to hypothesis testing demonstrates scientific rigor. Counter-evidence strengthens conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n| Rec | Priority | Type | Blocks Next L2? |\n|-----|----------|------|-----------------|\n| A. Outcome metrics | Critical | Process | Yes |\n| B. Architectural work (#143, DuckDB) | Critical | Engineering | Yes |\n| C. Verification sampling | High | Process | No |\n| D. Finalization investigation | Medium | Analysis | No |\n| E. Capture adoption trend | Low | Monitoring | No |\n| F. Hypothesis testing | Medium | Rigor | No |\n\n**Recommended next actions:**\n1. Implement outcome metrics (Rec A) - prerequisite for meaningful L2 cycles\n2. Execute architectural interventions (Rec B) - unblocks observation layer\n3. Add verification sampling to L2 discovery (Rec C) - reduces documentation debt\n4. Defer additional L2 cycles until quality >30% and tags >0.1 (enforcement of Rec A+B)\n\n**Timeline:** Measurement instrumentation (Rec B) blocks meaningful introspection progress. Prioritize architectural work over additional L2 cycles until foundational metrics improve.\n"

Now I need to analyze the 5 L2 documents and produce an L3 meta-analysis.\n\nLet me organize what I've learned from ingestion:\n\n**L2 Cycle 1 (1770168330):**\n- Date: 2026-02-03\n- First L2 introspection\n- Reviewed 5 retrospectives\n- Cross-session patterns: User is direct/decisive, simplicity signals are strong directives, agent spawn needs mode awareness, system infrastructure works but doesn't observe itself\n- Findings logged: 7 issues (#110-116)\n- Per-pillar: User effectiveness mature, execution strong (85%), alignment succeeds structurally (100% approval), system infra reliable but observation broken (3.1% quality, 0.0 tags)\n\n**L2 Cycle 2 (1770174872):**\n- Date: 2026-02-03\n- Second L2 introspection\n- Reviewed 2 retrospectives\n- Follow-up on C1: 71% closure rate (5/7 closed), but quality/tags unchanged despite closing #110\n- Cross-session patterns: Observation layer weakest link (tags 0.0, quality 3.2%), parallel agents maturing (8 agents, 0 collisions), tool trust requires qualification (MCP caching issue), meta-recursion accelerates improvement\n- Findings logged: 7 issues (#121-127)\n- Per-pillar: User interaction stable, execution 85.7%, alignment strongest (100% approval, #112 worked), system infra reliable but observation broken\n\n**L2 Cycle 3 (1770183546):**\n- Date: 2026-02-04\n- Third L2 introspection\n- Reviewed 3 retrospectives\n- Follow-up on C2: 100% closure rate (7/7 closed), but quality/tags still unchanged\n\n\n- Critical insight: closing issues doesn't resolve underlying problems\u2014both #121 and #111 marked done yet metrics flat. Execution quality actually improving (session 10 crushed 10 issues with zero retries), though known documentation remains unconsumed. The observation gap isn't incremental\u2014it's a structural architectural debt. Findings logged: 8 issues (#136-143).\n- Per-pillar: User effectiveness strongest, execution 86.7%, alignment strong but has blind spot (docs not consulted), system infra reliable but observation architectural problem\n\n**L2 Cycle 4 (1770188864):**\n- Date: 2026-02-04\n- Fourth L2 introspection\n- Reviewed 2 retrospectives + 2 improvement captures\n- Follow-up on C3: 75% closure (6/8 closed), 2 remaining (#142, #143)\n- Guidance keeps accumulating without verification (~14 additions, only 2 verified), yet execution quality continues climbing to 87.2%. Metrics stubbornly unmoved despite activity. Findings logged: 3 issues (#152-154), with increasing depth per issue.\n- Per-pillar: User effectiveness strongest, execution 87.2%, alignment strong but verification weak, system infra reliable but observation tools need refinement\n\n**L2 Cycle 5 (1770194370):**\n- Date: 2026-02-04\n- Fifth L2 introspection\n- Reviewed 2 retrospectives + 1 improvement capture\n- Follow-up on C4: 100% closure (5/5 closed), but 0/5 verified. Auto-tag uniformity stabilized at session-level, crush mode mature. Guidance verification debt now ~21 additions with only ~4 verified. Execution metrics holding steady at 87.8%. Findings logged: 5 issues (#160-164).\n- Per-pillar: User effectiveness strongest, execution 87.8%, alignment needs verification protocol, system infra reliable but observation needs refinement\n\nNow synthesizing across 5 cycles along 7 dimensions:\n\n1. **Skill Evolution Trajectory** - How has the improvement system itself changed?\n2. **Recurring Friction Inventory** - Problems appearing in 3+ cycles\n3. **Metric Trajectory Analysis** - Quantitative metrics across cycles\n4. **Intervention Effectiveness** - Classification by type, resolution rates\n5. **Observation Layer Meta-Assessment** - Is the system observing the right things?\n6. **Data Speaks** - Raw aggregated tables\n7. **Recommendations for Next Cycle** - Focus areas",
