Root problem unresolved. |\n    24\u2192| #111 (quality scores 3.2%) | Open | Investigated during triage, deferred -- needs build-time integration |\n    25\u2192| #112 (simplicity-matching) | Closed | Guidance added. No over-engineering in 2 subsequent sessions. |\n    26\u2192| #113 (doing mode detection) | Closed | Detection rules expanded |\n    27\u2192| #114 (task incompletion 15%) | Open | Task completion now 85.7% (up from 85%) |\n    28\u2192| #115 (T6 threshold) | Closed | Threshold corrected from 0.95 to 0.90 |\n    29\u2192| #116 (verbose finalization) | Closed | Compressed finalization implemented and immediately validated |\n    30\u2192\n    31\u2192**Closure rate:** 5/7 (71%). Two remaining issues (#111, #114) are investigations requiring deeper work.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192---\n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192### Pattern 1: Observation Layer Remains the Weakest Link\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192Despite closing #110, the tag system still produces zero discriminatory signal. All 83 tags have signal_score 0.0. The per-session scoping fix prevented cross-session leakage but didn't address the fundamental problem: rules fire uniformly across all sessions. Quality score coverage remains at 3.2%. The system works reliably but cannot measure how well it works. This was the top finding in L2 cycle 1 and remains the top finding in cycle 2.\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Trend:** Persistent. Two cycles, same core issue. #121 reopens this with a focus on rule discrimination rather than scope leakage.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Coordination Maturing but Has Blind Spots\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192The MVP session (8 agents, 4 waves) and triage session (6 agents, 3 waves) both executed cleanly with zero file collisions and no backward transitions. Parallelism mechanics are solid. However, exploration-phase parallelism has a quality gap: multiple agents independently confirm the same fact instead of dividing investigation dimensions.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Not visible in cycle 1 because previous sessions used fewer exploration agents.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192### Pattern 3: Tool Trust Requires Qualification\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192The MCP module caching issue (retrospective 1770174216) introduced a new category of system friction: tool output diverging from ground truth due to stale process state. This is distinct from previous tool issues (missing capabilities, wrong thresholds) -- it's a reliability hazard where the tool appears to work but returns stale data.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Specific to sessions where Python source is edited and then validated via MCP.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192### Pattern 4: Meta-Recursion Accelerates Improvement\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192The triage session (#120) implemented fixes from the previous self-improve cycle (#112, #113, #115, #116) and immediately validated two of them within the same session. #116 (compressed finalization) was used successfully at the session's end. This demonstrates a healthy feedback loop where self-improve findings translate to actionable fixes that are exercised in subsequent sessions.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192---\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**L1 observations:** User continues to be decisive and efficient. Compressed finalization (#116) validated. Triage alignment: 0.2 questions per issue. Visual review during planning surfaces concrete requirements.\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 85 issue-driven, 78 freeform tasks. 1 interruption in 90 sessions.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Synthesis:** User interaction is stable and efficient. The main improvement opportunity is structural: documenting triage wave patterns (#127) so future sessions benefit from the efficient structure observed in 1770174216. No regressions from cycle 1.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192**L1 observations:** Exploration redundancy (4 agents on same question).

In the taxonomy session, 13/15 questions used pre-offered options; 2 used \"Other\" when pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance. In the config session, a single directive sufficed for the entire task. The user consistently favors the most comprehensive/ambitious option and communicates at high velocity.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Implication:** Alignment questions are well-calibrated. The \"Other\" escape hatch works as designed. Verbosity in confirmations is friction, not thoroughness.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192### Pattern 2: Simplicity Signals Are Strong Directives\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192In 2 of 5 sessions (40%), the user redirected Claude away from over-engineering. The pattern: user references an existing implementation -> Claude proposes alternatives -> user says \"match the existing one.\" This is a systematic tendency, not a one-off.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Implication:** Claude's design exploration instinct conflicts with user's \"match proven patterns\" preference. This needs explicit counterprogramming in agent guidance.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### Pattern 3: Agent Spawn Decision Needs Mode Awareness\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192Session 1770160373 showed the orchestrator offering agent spawn when the user was in \"doing mode\" (editing directly in VSCode). The existing rule (3+ Bash calls) wasn't sufficient -- the user's mode was signaled by direct file edits, not bash commands.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Implication:** Doing mode detection needs richer signals beyond bash call count.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192### Pattern 4: System Infrastructure Works but Doesn't Observe Itself\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192All 5 sessions had clean builds, clean gate checks, successful PR workflows, and atomic skill handoffs. The infrastructure is reliable. However, the observation layer (tags, quality scores) is broken -- tags don't discriminate and quality scores cover only 3% of entries. The system works but can't measure how well it works.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192---\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**L1 observations:** User communication is efficient, alignment questions work well, finalization can be faster. Doing mode detection failed once.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries), 81 issue-driven vs 74 freeform tasks. No interruptions in 84/85 sessions.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Synthesis:** The user-facing interaction model is mature. The remaining friction is at the margins: verbose finalization confirmations and a single doing mode detection failure. Two issues logged (#113 doing mode, #116 verbose finalization).\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval rate, zero backward transitions. One session (taxonomy) executed 13 commits across 3 waves with zero regressions. Execution quality is high when aligned.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192**MCP findings:** 85% task completion rate. Finalization is the most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped.\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192**Synthesis:** Execution quality is strong but completion rate has room to improve. The 15% incompletion likely stems from context compaction in long sessions disrupting the finalization ceremony. One investigation issue logged (#114).\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192**L1 observations:** Over-engineering in 2/5 sessions when user had clear pattern reference. 100% plan approval on first presentation.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192**MCP findings:** 29/29 plans reached execution (100% approval). Zero backward transitions.\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192**Synthesis:** Alignment succeeds structurally (plans always approved) but Claude's tendency to explore design space creates friction when the user wants simplicity ma",

User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192**Effective patterns:**\n    14\u2192- User answered 5 alignment questions concisely via the multiple-choice format. Responses were direct and decisive, particularly \"SBS-Test only for Phase 1\" and \"all evergreen.\"\n    15\u2192- User's plan rejections were precise and actionable: first rejection identified insufficient data verification (\"make more expansive use of manual review via agents\"), second rejection clarified scope precisely (\"drop all of the tests not directly mentioned in the MVP, make at least 100 tests\").\n    16\u2192- The user established MVP.md as the sole source of truth for test scope, which was a clarification that prevented substantial wasted work.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Areas for improvement:**\n    19\u2192- User had to explicitly state \"we no longer support verso pages for MVP\" -- this information exists in CLAUDE.md under Known Limitations (\"All Verso page types have been removed from active surfaces\"). The agent should have known this without asking.\n    20\u2192- The \"at least 100 tests\" requirement came during the second plan rejection. Earlier surfacing of quantitative expectations during alignment could have avoided the second plan revision.\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192**Observation for L2:** The user's correction pattern suggests they expected Claude to already know project-specific constraints from CLAUDE.md. Pre-reading and synthesizing Known Limitations before alignment questions would prevent this class of error.\n    23\u2192\n    24\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192**What went wrong:**\n    27\u2192- **Verso pages inclusion (plan 1 and 2):** Tests were proposed for `paper_verso` and `blueprint_verso` pages despite CLAUDE.md explicitly listing them as removed from active surfaces. This was a failure to internalize the Known Limitations section before planning.\n    28\u2192- **GOALS.md scope leak (plan 2):** The first approved plan included tests for items from GOALS.md that were not in MVP.md. The user had to explicitly redirect: \"drop all of the tests not directly mentioned in the MVP.\" This shows the agent conflated the product vision (GOALS.md) with the current deliverable specification (MVP.md).\n    29\u2192- **Colon-to-hyphen ID mapping:** Node IDs use colons in Lean (`thm:main`) but are normalized to hyphens in HTML (`thm-main`). This was discovered at runtime when 13 tests failed. The information exists in sbs-developer.md under \"ID Normalization\" but was not applied during test writing.\n    30\u2192\n    31\u2192**What went right:**\n    32\u2192- After the two rejections, the third plan was tightly mapped to MVP.md criteria with a 1:1 correspondence.\n    33\u2192- Data exploration agents in Wave 0 of the approved plan successfully gathered manifest.json structure, HTML patterns, and CSS variable names. This prevented many more failures than the 13 that occurred.\n    34\u2192- The fix wave (Wave 4) efficiently resolved all 13 failures in a single pass.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**Assumption errors:**\n    37\u2192- Assumed dashboard stats in manifest.json would directly match HTML display values. In reality, Runway computes aggregated statistics (e.g., \"Completion\" percentage) that don't appear as raw fields in manifest.json. Tests had to be rewritten to check computed values rather than raw data.\n    38\u2192- Assumed all MVP criteria required code-level testing. Some criteria (like \"build completes without error\") were already covered by existing infrastructure.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192## 3. System Design\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192**Tooling that worked well:**\n    43\u2192- Parallel agent waves (3 waves of 2 agents each) provided clean parallelism for independent test files. No file collisions occurred.\n    44\u2192- The pytest evergreen tier marker system worked correctly -- all new tests were properly marked `@pytest.mark.evergreen` and integrated into the existing gate mechanism.\n    45\u2192- The `conftest.py` fixture infrastructure (manifest data, site path, parsed HTML) was reusable and well-structured for the new tests.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Tooling friction:**\n    48\u2192- No friction from MCP tools in this session. The primary friction was conceptual (understanding data transformations between Lean/manifest/HTML) rather than tooling-related.\n    49\u2192- The `helpers.py` module in the MVP test directory needed 5 new helper functions (`get_status_color_hex`, `parse_manifest_nodes`, `get_css_variables`, `normalize_node_id`, `get_html_status_dots`). These were straightforward additions but suggest the helper module was underscoped for the full MVP test surface.\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192**Missing automation:**\n    52\u2192- No automated way to preview test coverage mapping against MVP.md criteria.

User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192**Effective patterns:**\n    14\u2192- Alignment was completed in exactly 3 AskUserQuestion prompts, each using the multiple-choice format. The user's responses were decisive: scoped to 10 issues (excluding 4 architectural), confirmed wave grouping strategy, and approved the plan on first attempt.\n    15\u2192- During execution (5 waves, 7 agent invocations), zero user interruptions were needed. The wave-by-operation-type structure gave the user enough visibility to trust autonomous execution.\n    16\u2192- Finalization was a single confirmation prompt. The user approved merge after reviewing the gate results (689 evergreen, 66 self-improve, all 10 issues closed).\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Areas for improvement:**\n    19\u2192- None identified. This session's orchestration was the cleanest observed to date. The 3-question alignment pattern for batch operations should be codified.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Observation for L2:** The triage-by-actionability structure (5 tiers from \"immediately fixable\" to \"architectural redesign\") was highly effective for batch scoping. The user only needed to confirm/reject tier boundaries rather than evaluate each issue individually. This compressed what could have been 10+ alignment questions into 3.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192**What went right:**\n    26\u2192- Tier classification was well-calibrated. The 4 excluded issues (#128 architectural, #120 rethink, #118 community engagement, #115 integration-scale) were correctly identified as requiring separate dedicated sessions.\n    27\u2192- The decision to group Wave 2 issues (guidance prose: #127, #125, #124, #122) together was validated -- these were all SKILL.md/sbs-developer.md changes with similar edit patterns.\n    28\u2192- Feature request #131 (`/task crush`) was logged during alignment with design notes informed by the actual triage experience, capturing institutional knowledge while it was fresh.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**What went right (serendipitous):**\n    31\u2192- Wave 0 agent discovered and fixed 27 additional test failures beyond the 3 targeted. The pydantic import shim (`test_self_improve.py`) was not in any issue but was blocking the test suite. This was correctly identified and fixed without scope creep -- it was a prerequisite for the gate to pass.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192**Assumption errors:**\n    34\u2192- None that required correction during execution. The pre-execution exploration phase (3 parallel agents) gathered sufficient context to write accurate plans.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192## 3. System Design\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192**Tooling that worked well:**\n    39\u2192- The 5-wave structure (sequential except Waves 2 and 4 which ran parallel) was the right decomposition. Wave ordering respected the dependency chain: datetime fixes first (Wave 0) because they affected test infrastructure, then module caching (Wave 1) because validators depend on it, then guidance prose (Wave 2) and tagger logic (Wave 3) as independent concerns, then hardening (Wave 4) as a cross-cutting concern.\n    40\u2192- The `sbs_issue_log` tool was used effectively to log #131 during alignment -- zero friction, auto-populated archive context.\n    41\u2192- Gate mechanism worked perfectly: 689/689 evergreen + 66/66 self-improve tests at finalization.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192**Tooling friction:**\n    44\u2192- No meaningful friction. The MCP tools, archive system, and test infrastructure all functioned as expected.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192**Patterns validated:**\n    47\u2192- Wave grouping by operation type (from #127 guidance) was validated by this session. Grouping similar file-edit patterns together (e.g., all guidance prose in one wave) reduces context-switching overhead for agents.\n    48\u2192- Parallel agents for non-overlapping files (Wave 2: 2 agents on different files, Wave 4: 2 agents on different files) worked without collisions.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**Plan adherence:** The approved plan was executed exactly as written. All 5 waves completed in order, all 7 agent invocations succeeded on first attempt, zero mid-flight adjustments were needed.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**What was well-estimated:**\n    55\u2192- Wave complexity was accurately gauged. No wave took significantly longer than expected.\n    56\u2192- The decision to run Wave 0 first (datetime + pydantic fixes) was critical -- these fixes unblocked the test gate that all subsequent waves depended on.\n    57\u2192- Parallel waves (2 and 4) correctly identified non-overlapping file targets.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192**What was underestimated:**\n    60\u2192- Nothing.

User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192**Effective patterns:**\n    14\u2192- All 5 alignment questions were answered on first ask with zero clarification needed. The user's responses were well-informed and decisive: archive entries over GitHub issues (#133 storage), lightweight direct index write over heavyweight archive upload (#133 implementation), existing sbs_search_entries over a new query tool (#133 retrieval), propose-and-confirm over full auto (#134 autonomy), and both modes (all-open + subset) for #134 scope.\n    15\u2192- The compressed confirmation pattern at finalization (single approval covering merge + close + archive) worked smoothly with no friction.\n    16\u2192- Zero mid-execution interruptions. The user did not need to intervene between agent spawning and completion.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Areas for improvement:**\n    19\u2192- None identified. The 5-question alignment for 2-issue scope was appropriately sized. Fewer questions would have left ambiguity; more would have been wasteful.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Observation for L2:** The user's choice of \"archive entries with special tags\" over \"GitHub issues\" or \"dedicated file\" for improvement capture storage demonstrates preference for reusing existing infrastructure over creating new surfaces. This preference should inform future feature proposals.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192**What went right:**\n    26\u2192- Alignment completed in 2 rounds of AskUserQuestion (3 questions + 2 questions) covering all decision points for both issues. No misunderstandings or corrections were needed.\n    27\u2192- The 2 parallel exploration agents during planning were well-scoped: one for MCP server patterns (sbs_tools.py, sbs_models.py), one for SKILL.md structure. Both returned useful context that directly informed the plan.\n    28\u2192- The wave structure (2 parallel agents, one per issue) correctly identified the features as independent with non-overlapping file targets.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Assumption errors:**\n    31\u2192- The plan did not include updating the taxonomy dimension set test (`test_agent_state_taxonomy.py`). This was a known requirement (adding new tags requires updating the expected dimension set) but was not explicitly planned. The test failure was caught during execution and fixed, but this should have been a planned step.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192## 3. System Design\n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192**New pattern established:**\n    36\u2192- `sbs_improvement_capture` uses a direct index write path (inserting into `dev/storage/archive/index.jsonl` directly) instead of the standard `_run_archive_upload()` path that all other MCP tools use. This is intentional -- the tool needs to be zero-friction and fast, and a full archive upload is heavyweight. However, this creates a precedent that should be documented: there are now two pathways for writing archive entries.\n    37\u2192- The direct write approach means entries from `sbs_improvement_capture` bypass `ensure_porcelain()`, auto-tagging, and quality score attachment. This is acceptable for improvement captures (which are metadata-only) but the asymmetry should be noted.\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192**Reuse validated:**\n    40\u2192- The decision to use existing `sbs_search_entries` with tag filtering for retrieval (rather than building a new `sbs_improvement_query` tool) was sound. It avoids tool proliferation and leverages already-tested infrastructure.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192**Tooling friction:**\n    43\u2192- The taxonomy dimension set test is a maintenance burden: every new tag dimension requires updating the expected set. This is by design (it catches accidental dimension additions), but the coupling means feature PRs that add tags will always need a test update. The plan template should include a reminder.\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Plan adherence:** The approved plan was executed as written with one unplanned addition (taxonomy test fix). Both parallel agents completed successfully on first attempt.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192**What was well-estimated:**\n    50\u2192- The 2-agent parallel wave was the right structure for 2 independent features targeting non-overlapping files.\n    51\u2192- File targets were correctly identified: Agent 1 touched `sbs_tools.py` + `sbs_models.py`, Agent 2 touched `SKILL.md`. No collisions.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192**What was underestimated:**\n    54\u2192- The taxonomy test update was not planned. While the fix was trivial (adding `\"improvement\"` to the expected dimension set), it required a third file edit that could have been included in either agent's scope or as a cleanup step.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Agent efficiency:**\n    57\u2192- 2 agent invocations for 2 issu",

Currently requires manual `/task` invocation with freeform description each time.\\n\\n## Proposed Design: `/task crush`\\n\\nA variant of `/task` that automates the triage-and-execute pattern.\\n\\n### Alignment Phase (automated)\\n1. `sbs_issue_list()` loads all open issues\\n2. Agent categorizes into tiers by actionability:\\n   - **Tier 1 (Quick fixes):** Bugs with known root causes\\n   - **Tier 2 (Guidance/docs):** Process additions to SKILL.md, sbs-developer.md, etc.\\n   - **Tier 3 (Investigations):** May close with findings or convert to follow-ups\\n   - **Tier 4 (Code fixes):** Moderate-scope implementation work\\n   - **Tier 5 (Architectural):** Too large for crush -- stays open\\n3. Present triage to user for approval/adjustment\\n4. User confirms scope (which tiers/issues to include)\\n\\n### Planning Phase (structured)\\n- Waves grouped by operation type (per #127 guidance), NOT by issue number\\n- Wave ordering: quick fixes \u2192 guidance \u2192 investigations \u2192 code fixes\\n- File overlap analysis determines parallelism within waves\\n- Gates: evergreen tests pass, no regressions\\n\\n### Execution Phase\\n- Standard `/task` execution with multi-wave plan\\n- Each wave closes its targeted issues\\n- Autonomous bug logging for discoveries during execution\\n\\n### Design Notes from First Session\\n- Triage questions that proved useful:\\n  1. \\\"Real prose or close with intent?\\\" (for guidance issues)\\n  2. \\\"Fix if possible or diagnose + plan?\\\" (for investigations)\\n  3. \\\"Include code fixes or defer?\\\" (for moderate-scope bugs)\\n- The wave structure from #127 (investigate \u2192 docs \u2192 code) maps directly to crush tiers\\n- Architectural issues should be explicitly excluded with a note, not silently skipped\\n- Success criteria should enumerate expected closures upfront\\n\\n## Scope\\n- `.claude/skills/task/SKILL.md` -- add crush argument handling\\n- Possibly `.claude/agents/sbs-developer.md` -- triage patte",

Fix: rule redesign. Result: No improvement.\n- Cycle 3 (current): Tags still uniformly at 0.0. All v2 tags fire at 22.6% rate.\n\n## Decision\n\nPer user direction, defer tag improvement to the DuckDB query layer (#118). The tagging problem is better solved by changing the analytical substrate (SQL queries over structured data) rather than fixing the rule-based tagger. DuckDB will enable:\n- Ad-hoc queries that don't need pre-computed tags\n- Window functions for trend detection\n- `UNNEST` for hierarchical data analysis\n- Elimination of the tag discrimination problem entirely\n\n## Current State\n\nThe auto-tagger continues to run but produces no actionable signal. It adds ~84 tags to every entry with zero discrimination. This is noise, not data.\n\n## Proposed Action\n\n1. Keep auto-tagger running (no regression risk from removal)\n2. Prioritize #118 (DuckDB) as the path forward for archive analytics\n3. Once DuckDB is operational, evaluate whether auto-tagging adds value or should be deprecated\n4.

        "content": "# Self-Improvement Summary: 1770183546\n\n**Date:** 2026-02-04\n**Cycle:** Third L2 introspection\n**Retrospectives reviewed:** 3 (1770178263, 1770180967, 1770182650)\n**MCP analysis tools queried:** 13 (all functional, including previously broken sbs_question_stats)\n\n---\n\n## Retrospectives Reviewed\n\n| Entry ID | Task | Key Observation |\n|----------|------|-----------------|\n| 1770178263 | MVP Test Suite Expansion (#119) -- 102 new tests, 3 waves | 2 plan rejections from not reading Known Limitations (Verso pages), 13 test failures from undocumented ID normalization assumptions |\n| 1770180967 | Batch Issue Crush (10 issues) -- 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries | Cleanest session to date. Triage-by-actionability compressed alignment to 3 questions. Zero user interventions during execution. |\n| 1770182650 | /task #133 #134 -- 2 parallel agents, 0 retries | Dual archive write paths created (full pipeline vs direct JSONL). Taxonomy test coupling flagged as recurring maintenance. |\n\n---\n\n## Previous Cycle Follow-Up\n\n| Issue | Status | Outcome |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| #121 (tag discrimination) | Closed | Rules redesigned, but ALL tags still signal_score 0.0. Third cycle with same result. Approach deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). |\n| #122 (exploration differentiation) | Closed | Guidance added. Not directly tested in subsequent sessions (no multi-agent exploration in the 3 sessions reviewed). |\n| #123 (MCP module caching) | Closed | Fixed with importlib.reload(). No recurrence in subsequent sessions. |\n| #124 (call-chain tracing) | Closed | Guidance added. Dead code detection not tested in subsequent sessions. |\n| #125 (test cleanup on removal) | Closed | Guidance added. No feature removals in subsequent sessions to validate. |\n| #126 (question_stats datetime) | Closed | Fixed. Tool now returns 544 questions across 81 sessions. Fully functional. |\n| #127 (triage wave structure) | Closed | Guidance added and immediately validated in crush session (1770180967). |\n\n**Closure rate:** 7/7 (100%, up from 71% in cycle 1).\n\n**Key finding:** High closure rate does not guarantee metric improvement. #121 and #111 were closed but their target metrics (tag discrimination, quality coverage) show zero improvement. Issue closure tracked code changes; downstream metric verification was missing.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Session Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Issue Closure != Problem Resolution\n\nThe most important meta-observation of this cycle. Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:\n- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)\n- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)\n\n**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.\n\n**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.\n\n### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve\n\nThe crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:\n- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%\n- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)\n- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)\n- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)\n\nThe exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).\n\n### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted\n\nThe MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:\n1. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning\n2. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing\n\nThis is distinct from the \"simplicity matching\" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.\n\n### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental\n\nThree cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero improvement in the metrics that matter. The conclusion: the observation layer's problems are architectural, not implementational:\n- Tags: Rule-based classification is the wrong abstraction for session characterization. DuckDB (#118) will bypass this entirely.\n- Quality scores: Standalone tooling is the wrong delivery mechanism. Build pipeline integration (#143) addresses the root cause.\n\nThis cycle explicitly acknowledges that further incremental tag fixes are futile and redirects effort to the DuckDB path.\n\n---\n\n## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n\n### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n\n**L1 observations:** User continues to be direct and decisive. Crush session alignment: 3 questions for 10 issues. #133/#134 session: 5 questions for 2 design-heavy issues. Zero mid-execution interruptions across all 3 sessions.\n\n**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 1 interruption in 97 sessions. `sbs_question_stats` now working: 544 questions, 81 sessions with questions, user overwhelmingly selects pre-offered options.\n\n**Synthesis:** User interaction remains the strongest pillar. The question_stats data (now accessible) confirms the multiple-choice format works well. No regressions. One new finding: quantitative expectations should be probed during alignment (#139).\n\n### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n\n**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in the crush session (first ever for a 10-issue task). Taxonomy test coupling as recurring maintenance burden. ID normalization knowledge not applied despite being documented.\n\n**MCP findings:** Task completion 86.7% (up from 85.7%). 0 backward transitions. Finalization remains most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped in 45 tasks.\n\n**Synthesis:** Execution quality is improving. The zero-retry crush session validates the exploration-then-plan pattern. Two process gaps identified: (1) agents don't consult subsystem documentation before writing code (#137), (2) plan templates miss taxonomy test updates (#140). Both are guidance additions.\n\n### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n\n**L1 observations:** 2 plan rejections in MVP session (from not reading Known Limitations), but 100% approval on first attempt in the other 2 sessions. Quantitative expectations not probed.\n\n**MCP findings:** 31/31 plans reached execution (100% approval). 0 backward transitions.\n\n**Synthesis:** Alignment is strong overall but has a specific blind spot: agents don't incorporate project constraints from documentation before planning. The pre-flight checklist (#136) and quantitative probing (#139) address this. The 2 rejections in the MVP session are an outlier caused by a specific, fixable gap.\n\n### Pillar 4: System Engineering\n\n**L1 observations:** Dual archive write paths created (sbs_improvement_capture). sbs_entries_since_self_improve returns current session's entry. sbs_question_stats now working.\n\n**MCP findings:** 0/26 gate failures. Quality score coverage 3.1%. All tags signal_score 0.0. 19 legacy tags. Overall health: \"healthy.\"\n\n**Synthesis:** Infrastructure reliability (builds, gates, PRs, handoffs) remains solid. The observation layer debt is now explicitly acknowledged as structural and redirected to architectural solutions (DuckDB for tags, build pipeline for quality scores). Two new tooling bugs identified: sbs_entries_since_self_improve boundary detection (#141), sbs_improvement_capture needs e2e test (#142).\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Observations\n\n### Improvement Velocity Accelerating\n\nCycle 1: 7 issues, 71% closure rate. Cycle 2: 7 issues, 100% closure rate. Cycle 3: 8 issues logged. If the 100% closure trend continues, all 8 should be resolved before cycle 4.\n\n### Finding Categories Maturing\n\n- Cycle 1: Discovery-oriented (\"we don't know X\", \"we can't measure Y\")\n- Cycle 2: Refinement-oriented (\"the fix for X didn't go far enough\")\n- Cycle 3: Architectural recognition (\"incremental fixes don't work for X, need structural change\")\n\nThis is a healthy progression. The system is learning to distinguish between implementational problems (fixable with code changes) and architectural problems (requiring redesign).\n\n### Observation Layer Decision Point\n\nThe explicit decision to defer tags to DuckDB and redirect quality scores to the build pipeline marks a shift from \"fix what exists\" to \"replace what doesn't work.\" This is the right call after 3 cycles of evidence, but it means the observation layer will remain weak until #118 and #143 are implemented.\n\n### sbs_improvement_capture Validated\n\nThe new tool was used during this session (entry 1770183043) to capture the `sbs_entries_since_self_improve` bug in real-time. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow. Full e2e test coverage still needed (#142).\n\n---\n\n## Findings Logged\n\n| # | Issue | Pillar | Impact |\n|---|-------|--------|--------|\n| #136 | Pre-flight checklist: read Known Limitations before planning | Alignment | High |\n| #137 | Consult documentation before writing subsystem-specific code | Claude Execution | High |\n| #138 | Defer auto-tagger improvement to DuckDB (#118) | System Engineering | High |\n| #143 | Integrate quality score validators into build.py | System Engineering | High |\n| #139 | Probe quantitative success criteria during alignment | Alignment | Medium |\n| #140 | Plan template: taxonomy test reminder for tag changes | Claude Execution | Medium |\n| #141 | Fix sbs_entries_since_self_improve boundary detection | System Engineering | Medium |\n| #142 | Add end-to-end test for sbs_improvement_capture | System Engineering | Low |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Next Cycle\n\n1. **Verify #136 and #137 (documentation consultation).** These are the highest-leverage guidance fixes. Check if subsequent sessions show agents reading Known Limitations and subsystem docs before planning/executing.\n2. **Track #118 (DuckDB) progress.** This is now the designated fix path for the persistent tag discrimination problem. If #118 hasn't been started by cycle 4, consider whether the architectural direction needs revision.\n3. **Verify #143 (build pipeline quality scores).** After implementation, quality score coverage should jump significantly. If it doesn't, the integration point needs debugging.\n4. **Check sbs_improvement_capture usage.** Were any improvement observations captured between cycles? This tool's value is in the data it collects, not in its existence.\n5. **Issue closure verification.** This cycle identified that closing issues doesn't guarantee metric improvement. Consider adding a \"metric verification\" step to the /task finalization phase: after closing issues that reference specific metrics, verify the metric actually changed.\n6. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Cycle 1: 7 issues. Cycle 2: 7 issues (100% cycle-1 closure). Cycle 3: 8 issues. Closure rate improving (71% -> 100%). Finding categories shifting from discovery to architectural recognition. Observation layer debt explicitly acknowledged and redirected.\n"

Let me run all the MCP analysis tools in parallel to process these.",

      "content": "Now I have all the data. Let me synthesize the findings.\n\nKey observations:\n\n**From retrospectives (L1):**\n\n1. **Retrospective 1770178263 (MVP Test Suite):**\n   - Two plan rejections due to not reading Known Limitations in CLAUDE.md (Verso pages removed)\n   - Colon-to-hyphen ID normalization missed despite being documented in sbs-developer.md\n   - User had to specify \"at least 100 tests\" during second rejection -- quantitative expectations should be probed earlier\n   - Data exploration before test writing is a valuable pattern but didn't cover enough depth (dashboard rendering logic, ID normalization)\n   - A pre-flight checklist should include Known Limitations\n\n2. **Retrospective 1770180967 (Batch Issue Crush - 10 Issues):**\n   - Cleanest session yet with 10 of 14 issues closed, no retries, and a triage-by-actionability tier system that compressed alignment to just three questions\n   - Wave-by-operation-type grouping validated the approach, and Wave 0 serendipitously uncovered 27 additional test failures through a pydantic import shim fix\n   - Zero user interventions needed during execution\n\n3. **Retrospective 1770182650 (/task #133 #134):**\n   - Executed cleanly with 2 of 2 issues closed in parallel with zero retries, introducing a dual archive write path pattern that lets us choose between full pipeline or direct JSONL append\n   - Taxonomy dimension set testing keeps surfacing as recurring maintenance coupling, so the plan template should flag this as a reminder\n   - The `sbs_improvement_capture` feature was verified through code review but still needs an end-to-end test, and the user prefers reusing existing infrastructure rather than building new surfaces\n\nLooking at the metrics now: task completion is at 86.7%, up from 85.7% last cycle, with all 31 plan approvals coming through. The exploration-then-plan pattern is giving us enough context to avoid mid-flight corrections, so I should codify this as a standard batch operation approach.\n\nThe performance data shows gate failures still at zero across 26 attempts, no backward transitions, and only one interruption across 97 sessions. Quality score coverage barely budged to 3.1%, and the signal_score tags are still stuck at 0.0 for the third cycle\u2014#121 was supposed to address this but clearly didn't. The backlog is now completely cleared though, and `sbs_question_stats` is finally working after the #126 fix, returning 544 questions across sessions.\n\nLooking at the closed issues from the crush session, #121's tag discrimination fix didn't actually resolve the underlying problem since all tags still fire uniformly. #122 through #125 were all closed in that session, and #127's triage wave structure was validated in the subsequent session. The main concern is whether these fixes are actually taking effect or if they're just marked closed without solving the core issues.\n\nNow examining cross-session patterns, I'm seeing a critical gap: agents keep proposing tests for Verso pages despite CLAUDE.md explicitly listing them as removed. This happened twice in the MVP session alone, suggesting agents aren't consulting the Known Limitations before planning. I should add a pre-flight checklist step to catch this earlier. The most troubling pattern is that tags still aren't discriminating after three cycles\u2014every signal_score remains at 0.0, and the per-session scoping approach from cycle 1 clearly didn't work.\n\nQuality score coverage is stuck at 3.1% even after closing #111, which tells me the fix addressed the mechanism but doesn't trigger during automated builds. There's also a recurring maintenance burden where adding new tags requires manual updates to the taxonomy test file, and I'm noticing that the archive write path has dual routes\u2014one bypasses the full pipeline entirely.\n\nThe zero-retry execution pattern from the crush session is validating well though: 10 issues across 5 waves with 7 agents and no retries shows the exploration-then-plan approach gives enough context. Question stats are also looking solid with 544 analyzed, and users are clearly preferring pre-offered options. Now I'm starting to organize these findings into pillars, beginning with user effectiveness.\n\nTwo plan rejections happened because the agent didn't know Verso pages had been removed\u2014medium impact but preventable through the existing documentation. On the execution side, task completion is trending upward from 85% to 86.7%, though finalization remains the sticking point. The plan approval rate staying at 100% is good, but I'm noticing the ID normalization knowledge from sbs-developer.md wasn't applied during test writing, leading to 13 failures from colon-to-hyphen mapping issues. The taxonomy test keeps surfacing as recurring maintenance work across sessions, so the plan template needs a reminder about that.\n\nLooking at alignment patterns, the 100% approval rate and zero backward transitions are solid, but I should be probing for quantitative expectations earlier\u2014the \"at least 100 tests\" requirement only came up during the second plan rejection. On the system engineering side, the tagging issue is the most stubborn problem across three cycles now with signal scores stuck at 0.0 across the board, which suggests the auto-tagging abstraction itself might be wrong. Quality score coverage is still barely moving at 3.1%, the dual archive write paths need documentation, and the end-to-end testing for the improvement capture system is missing. I'm starting to see that agents should be reading the Known Limitations section before starting work.\n\nNow I'm organizing these findings by priority and owner\u2014there's documented knowledge about ID normalization and data transformations that isn't being applied, the taxonomy tests are too tightly coupled to the plan template, and I need to check whether the cycle 2 recommendations have actually been addressed.\n\nLooking back at what was supposed to happen: tag discrimination still isn't producing any signal after three cycles, the exploration guidance issues closed but scope drift persisted in testing, MCP caching got fixed, and question_stats is now working. Completion improved slightly from 85.7% to 86.7%, but quality metrics stayed flat at 3.1-3.2% and tags remain at zero. The closure rate jumped to 100% though\u2014all seven issues from cycle 2 got resolved.\n\nNow I'm distinguishing between what's actually new versus what keeps recurring. The pre-flight checklist gap, taxonomy test coupling, dual archive writes, and the need for end-to-end testing on the improvement capture tool are genuinely fresh insights. But tags still aren't discriminating and quality coverage is stuck at 3.1%, which means the incremental approach isn't working\u2014I need to try something fundamentally different for these persistent problems.",

      "content": "Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me synthesize the findings.\n\n**Previous cycle follow-up:**\n- All 7 cycle 2 issues (#121-#127) are closed. 100% closure rate.\n- #121 (tag discrimination): Closed, but tags STILL show signal_score 0.0. The fix addressed specific rule issues but the fundamental problem persists.\n- #126 (question_stats): Fixed! Tool now works and returns 544 questions.\n- #111 (quality scores): Closed. But coverage is still 3.1%.\n- #114 (task completion): Closed. Rate improved slightly (86.7%).\n\n\n- Issues are being closed, but the underlying metrics for tags and quality scores haven't improved\u2014the fixes may have addressed symptoms without solving root causes.\n- The backlog is completely cleared with 0 open issues.\n\n**Finding 1: [Alignment] Agents don't pre-read Known Limitations before planning** (HIGH)\n- Evidence: Retrospective 1770178263 shows two plan rejections where the agent proposed tests for Verso pages, which are explicitly listed as removed in CLAUDE.md Known Limitations. The user had to clarify that verso pages are no longer supported for MVP, even though this is documented.\n- Recommendation: Add a pre-flight checklist to SKILL.md planning phase requiring agents to review CLAUDE.md Known Limitations before proposing any plan.\n\n**Finding 2: [Alignment] Quantitative success criteria not probed during alignment** (MEDIUM)\n- Evidence: Retrospective 1770178263 reveals the \"at least 100 tests\" requirement only surfaced during the second plan rejection. The alignment phase covered scope and iteration model but never asked about quantitative expectations.\n- Recommendation: Guidance should be added to the alignment phase to explicitly ask for quantitative expectations when tasks involve creating artifacts like tests, issues, or files.\n\n**Finding 3: [Claude] Documented knowledge not applied during execution** (HIGH)\n- Evidence: Retrospective 1770178263 shows 13 test failures stemming from colon-to-hyphen ID normalization, which is documented in sbs-developer.\n\nmd under \"ID Normalization\", plus a dashboard data model mismatch between manifest.json raw data and rendered computed values.\n- Recommendation: Exploration agents need a checklist of relevant documentation sections to review before writing code that interacts with specific subsystems.\n\n**Finding 4: [Claude] Taxonomy test coupling causes recurring unplanned work** (MEDIUM)\n- Evidence: Retrospective 1770182650 identifies the taxonomy dimension set test as a recurring maintenance coupling that's already caused unplanned work across 2 sessions.\n- Recommendation: Add to the plan template a step requiring test_agent_state_taxonomy.py updates whenever new tags or dimensions are added.\n\n**Finding 5: [System] Tag discrimination remains ineffective after 3 cycles and closure of #121** (HIGH)\n- Evidence: sbs_tag_effectiveness data shows all tags at signal_score 0.0, indicating the tagging system isn't differentiating effectively.\n- The core issue persists despite closing #121 \u2014 tags still don't vary meaningfully between sessions, which was the primary concern flagged in cycle 2.\n- Recommendation: Deprecate the auto-tagging system entirely since three cycles of effort haven't produced discriminating signal. Tags are adding noise to every entry, so replacing this with targeted event logging that only records notable occurrences would be more effective than trying to classify every session.\n\n**Finding 6: [System] Quality score coverage remains minimal after 3 cycles and closure of #111** (HIGH)\n- Evidence: sbs_system_health shows only 19 out of 610 entries have quality scores, leaving coverage at 3.1%.\n- Despite closing #111, the coverage hasn't improved, suggesting the underlying approach needs reconsideration.\n- Recommendation: Quality scores should be automatically attached during the build process rather than handled as a separate manual step \u2014 this requires integrating the auto-validate logic directly into the build script.\n\n**Finding 7: [System] Dual archive write paths need consistency policy** (LOW)\n- The `sbs_improvement_capture` pathway bypasses the full archive pipeline, creating asymmetry where some entries receive auto-tagging and quality scores while others don't.\n- This is currently acceptable but needs documentation.\n- Recommendation: Document both pathways in ARCHITECTURE.md and clarify when each should be used.\n\n**Finding 8: [System] `sbs_improvement_capture` not end-to-end tested** (LOW)\n- Evidence: Retrospective 1770182650 shows this was only verified through code review, with end-to-end MCP testing still pending after a server restart.\n- Recommendation: Run a functional test to validate the complete flow.\n\n**Finding 9: [User] Question stats tool now working -- enables new analysis capabilities** (informational)\n- The tool is returning 544 questions across 81 sessions, revealing that the user consistently selects pre-offered options and rarely uses \"Other.\"\n- Most common question headers align with project domains like layout, tooling, and features.\n- No action needed \u2014 this unlocks new analysis capabilities.\n\nNow I'm looking at cross-session patterns and noticing something important: issue closure doesn't necessarily mean the underlying problem is resolved. Both #121 and #111 were closed during the crush session, but the metrics haven't actually improved. The issues may have been closed based on expected code fixes that didn't produce the downstream effects we anticipated.\n\nSession execution quality is consistently strong \u2014 the crush session handled 10 issues with zero retries across 5 waves, and the #133/#134 session ran 2 issues in parallel with clean execution. Task completion rates are steadily climbing. Alignment is also improving: the crush session needed only 3 alignment questions for 10 issues, while the #133/#134 session required 5 questions for design decisions. The two plan rejections in the MVP session stand out as an anomaly, but the root cause \u2014 not reading Known Limitations \u2014 is fixable.\n\nThe real structural problem is in the observation layer. I've cycled through three rounds of findings about tags and quality scores, but the fixes haven't stuck because the underlying approach is flawed, not the implementation.
