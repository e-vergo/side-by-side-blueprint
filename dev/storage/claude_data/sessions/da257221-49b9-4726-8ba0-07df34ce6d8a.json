Here's what I can see:\n\n1. **Eric Vergo** started it as a discussion thread for the #announce > Side-by-side blueprint - Experience prototype\n2. **Ya\u00ebl Dillies** asks if it could be a VSCode extension or in the lean infoview instead of a website, since building the blueprint takes long and you might miss a dependency\n\n\n3. **Alex Kontorovich** suggests serving locally where it builds much faster, and **Ya\u00ebl Dillies** mentions he can now do local setup with his university's computing resources\n4. **Eric Vergo** acknowledges the infoview idea has merit but notes space constraints, then shares some performance metrics showing significant speedups with caching (GCR builds drop from 42.9s to 13.2s, PNT from 23.5 min to 17.9s), and indicates they're still weighing whether to pursue a VSCode extension given various design considerations\n5. They've decided to go with HTML display since it aligns with what leanblueprint originally used, and **Ya\u00ebl Dillies** proposes simply adapting the page layout to fit VSCode's narrow infoview window",

The issue says:\n\n- **Ya\u00ebl Dillies**: Build times too long; wants VSCode/infoview integration\n- **Alex Kontorovich**: TeX and Lean should live in same file (PNT+ delimiter approach)\n\nBut from the actual thread:\n1. **Alex Kontorovich** only said \"You can serve it locally, where it builds much faster.\" He did NOT mention anything about TeX and Lean living in the same file or the PNT+ delimiter approach.\n2. **Ya\u00ebl Dillies** asked about VSCode extension or infoview integration, and mentioned build times. This is accurate.\n\n\n3. Ya\u00ebl also suggested displaying stripped-down HTML in the infoview panel.\n\nSo the issue misattributes the PNT+ delimiter approach to Alex when it doesn't appear in this thread\u2014it might be from the announce thread or elsewhere. I should check the Zulip links referenced in the issue to see if they clarify where this position actually came from.\n\nLooking at the links, I notice the discussion thread stream number is wrong\u2014it shows 274007 but should be 536994. The announce stream is 113486. Beyond that, the issue captures Ya\u00ebl's feedback reasonably well but misses the specific infoview suggestion about rendering LaTeX of the current declaration in the narrow panel. It also doesn't include the caching benchmarks from the thread showing significant improvements for both GCR and PNT. I should suggest these updates.",

Alex's feedback about TeX/Lean in same file came from offline conversation - so the attribution in the issue is fine, just sourced differently than the thread.\n2. The infoview LaTeX rendering idea was Eric's own suggestion in response to Ya\u00ebl, not Ya\u00ebl's request. Looking back at the thread, Eric (message 5) asked \"what were you imagining? showing the rendered Latex of the declaration you're in?\" - that was Eric proposing it, not Ya\u00ebl requesting it. Ya\u00ebl's actual suggestions were: (a) VSCode extension or infoview integration to avoid switching between VSCode and browser, and (b) strip down the page to fit narrow window in VSCode.\n\n\nSo I need to correct my understanding: the LaTeX rendering was Eric's idea, not Ya\u00ebl's.
