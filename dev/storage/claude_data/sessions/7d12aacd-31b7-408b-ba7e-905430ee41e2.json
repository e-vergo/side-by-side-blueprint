DUAL AUTHORING MODES\\n\\n**MVP Claim:** TeX mode (`\\\\inputleannode{label}`) AND Verso mode (`:::leanNode \\\"label\\\"`), producing equivalent HTML output.\\n\\n**Reality:**\\n- \\u2713 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**\\n  \\n  **TeX Mode (leanblueprint-compatible):**\\n  - \\u2713 Implemented: `\\\\inputleannode{label}` parser in `/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Latex/Parser.lean`\\n  - \\u2713 Placeholder expansion in `/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Theme.lean`\\n  - \\u2713 Both `blueprint.tex` files found in SBS-Test and showcase projects\\n  - Evidence: Grep shows `inputleannode` command parsing and expansion support\\n\\n  **Verso Mode (native Lean):**\\n  - \\u2713 Implemented: `:::leanNode \\\"label\\\"` directive in Verso fork\\n  - \\u2713 Files: `/forks/verso/src/verso-sbs/SBSBlueprint/Hooks.lean` (directive expanders)\\n  - \\u2713 Rendering: `/forks/verso/src/verso-sbs/SBSBlueprint/Render.lean` (HTML generation)\\n  - Evidence: Both modes load manifest.json and precomputed artifacts from `.lake/build/dressed/`\\n  \\n  **Equivalence:** Both modes render to identical HTML structures using `decl.html` and `decl.json` from Dress artifacts\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. DEPENDENCY GRAPH\\n\\n**MVP Claim:** Interactive visualization with pan/zoom, click nodes, filter controls, logical dependencies.\\n\\n**Reality:**\\n- \\u2713 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**\\n  - Sugiyama hierarchical layout: `/toolchain/Dress/Dress/Graph/Layout.lean` (~1,500 lines)\\n  - SVG generation: `/toolchain/Dress/Dress/Graph/Svg.lean` with node shapes (ellipses for theorems, rectangles for definitions)\\n  - Edge styles: Solid for proof dependencies, dashed for statement dependencies\\n  - Pan/zoom: `verso-code.js` implements pointer events (drag, wheel zoom) with `fitToWindow()`\\n  - Modals: Node click opens side-by-side display in modal\\n  - Evidence: Generated sites include `/dep_graph.html` with interactive controls\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. STATUS INDICATORS (6-Color Model)\\n\\n**MVP Claim:** Six-color status model reflecting proof state with exact hex values.\\n\\n**Reality:**\\n- \\u2713 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**\\n  - Canonical definitions in `/toolchain/Dress/Dress/Graph/Svg.lean` (lines 19-25):\\n    - `notReady: #F4A460` (Sandy Brown) \\u2713\\n    - `ready: #20B2AA` (Light Sea Green) \\u2713\\n    - `sorry: #8B0000` (Dark Red) \\u2713\\n    - `proven: #90EE90` (Light Green) \\u2713\\n    - `fullyProven: #228B22` (Forest Green) \\u2713\\n    - `mathlibReady: #87CEEB` (Light Blue) \\u2713\\n  - CSS variables match exactly in `/dress-blueprint-action/assets/common.css` (lines 97-102)\\n  - Status dots rendered at multiple sizes: 8px (default), 10px (headers), 12px (modals)\\n  - Evidence: Dashboard, key declarations, dependency graph modals all show correct colors\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. DASHBOARD\\n\\n**MVP Claim:** Landing page with stats, key theorems, messages, notes, navigation.\\n\\n**Reality:**\\n- \\u2713 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**\\n  - Generated as `index.html` in each project's `.lake/build/runway/`\\n  - 2x2 grid layout with:\\n    - **Stats panel:** Pie chart showing status breakdown (notReady, ready, sorry, proven, fullyProven, mathlibReady)\\n    - **Key Theorems panel:** Declarations marked `(keyDeclaration := true)`\\n    - **Messages panel:** User notes from `(message := \\\"...\\\")` attributes\\n    - **Project Notes panel:** Blocked, potentialIssues, technicalDebt, misc categories\\n  - Evidence: `/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Render.lean` implements `renderDashboard`, `renderKeyDeclarations`, `renderMessages`, `renderProjectNotes`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. PAPER GENERATION\\n\\n**MVP Claim:** Academic paper output (HTML and PDF) with verification badges linking to formal proofs, supporting both TeX and Verso authoring.\\n\\n**Reality:**\\n- \\u2713 **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**\\n  - ar5iv-style HTML: Generated as `paper_tex.html`\\n  - PDF compilation: Supports tectonic, pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex with auto-detection\\n  - Verification badges: Show status (Verified=green, In Progress=yellow, Not Started=gray)\\n  - Badge linking: Links to corresponding blueprint pages\\n  - LaTeX hooks: `\\\\paperstateme",

Generated at: `paper_tex.html` in all projects. Files: GCR (~63KB), PNT (none - no paper configured), SBS-Test (~11KB) |\\n| **PDF generation via LaTeX** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | `paper.pdf` files exist and are valid PDFs. SBS-Test: 126KB, GCR: 243KB. Generated via texlive pipeline in dress-blueprint-action step 12. Uses `\\\\paperTexPath` config |\\n| **Verification badges** | \\u26a0\\ufe0f PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED | CSS classes defined (`.verification-badge`, `.verified`, `.in-progress`, `.not-started`) with proper styling and colors defined in `common.css` (lines 86-91 light, 300-305 dark). **However**: No instances of actual badge markup found in examined paper_tex.html outputs. Classes exist but not being populated into generated HTML |\\n| **Supports both TeX and Verso** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED (TeX only for papers) | TeX papers working (all 3 projects). Verso document support exists in SBS-Test via `Blueprint.lean` (Verso genre) and `Paper.lean` (both files exist). BUT: `paperTexPath` in runway.json points to `.tex` files only. PNT has no paper configured. GCR and SBS-Test have LaTeX papers working |\\n\\n### Key Files\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/paper.css` - Styling framework\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Latex/ToHtml.lean` - LaTeX to HTML conversion\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Latex/ToLatex.lean` - LaTeX processing\\n\\n### Discrepancies\\n\\n1. **Verification badges (medium gap):** The CSS framework is built but badges are not being rendered in the HTML. The infrastructure exists (`verification-badge` class with themed styling) but no actual `<span class=\\\"verification-badge verified\\\">` elements appear in generated paper outputs. This suggests the Runway paper generator knows about the CSS but doesn't populate the markup.\\n\\n2. **Verso paper support (minor gap):** The MVP says \\\"supports both TeX and Verso authoring\\\" for papers. Verso document infrastructure exists (genres in verso forks), but configured `runway.json` for all projects uses only `paperTexPath` (pointing to `.tex`), not a Verso equivalent. SBS-Test has `Paper.lean` but no configuration activates it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## SECTION 7: CI/CD Integration\\n\\n### MVP Claims\\n```\\nGitHub Action\\nSingle workflow file addition\\nBuilds toolchain, generates site, deploys to Pages\\nNo local tooling required for users\\n```\\n\\n### Actual Implementation\\n\\n| Claim | Status | Evidence |\\n|--------|--------|----------|\\n| **GitHub Action exists** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | `e-vergo/dress-blueprint-action@main` (432 lines in action.yml, 3,805 lines of CSS/JS assets) |\\n| **Single workflow file** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | All 3 projects use identical 32-line workflow YAML: `.github/workflows/full-blueprint-build-and-deploy.yml` |\\n| **Builds toolchain** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | 14-step pipeline (documented in dress-blueprint-action README) builds: SubVerso -> LeanArchitect -> Dress -> Runway in order |\\n| **Generates site** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | Step 11 runs Runway site generation. Outputs: dashboard, dep_graph, chapters, paper_tex.html, paper.pdf, assets |\\n| **Deploys to Pages** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | Step 14 uses `actions/deploy-pages@v4` with artifact upload |\\n| **No local tooling required** | \\u2705 IMPLEMENTED | Workflow is self-contained; user only runs workflow dispatch; no local setup needed. Action handles: Lean installation, texlive, mathlib cache fetch, Lake builds |\\n\\n### Build Times (from ARCHITECTURE.md)\\n| Project | Time | Nodes |\\n|---------|------|-------|\\n| SBS-Test | ~15 min | 33 |\\n| GCR | ~25 min | 57 |\\n| PNT | ~35 min | 591 |\\n\\n### Key Files\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/SBS-Test/.github/workflows/full-blueprint-build-and-deploy.yml` - Minimal workflow (32 lines)\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/README.md` - Complete action documentation\\n- `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/action.yml` - Action definition\\n\\n### Assessment\\n**No gaps.** CI/CD implementation exactly matches MVP claims.

Here's the current architecture:\\n\\n**File: `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Paper.lean`**\\n\\n**Badge Rendering Function (lines 72-82):**\\n```lean\\n/-- Render verification badge HTML -/\\ndef renderBadge (level : VerificationLevel) : Html :=\\n  let (cls, icon, label) := match level with\\n    | .verified => (\\\"verified\\\", \\\"check\\\", \\\"Verified\\\")\\n    | .inProgress => (\\\"in-progress\\\", \\\"half\\\", \\\"In Progress\\\")\\n    | .notStarted => (\\\"not-started\\\", \\\"circle\\\", \\\"Not Started\\\")\\n  .tag \\\"span\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", s!\\\"verification-badge {cls}\\\"),\\n               (\\\"title\\\", \\\"Formalization status\\\")] (\\n    .tag \\\"span\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", s!\\\"badge-icon badge-icon-{icon}\\\")] Html.empty ++\\n    .tag \\\"span\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", \\\"badge-text\\\")] (Html.text true label)\\n  )\\n```\\n\\n**Verification Level Definition (lines 49-63):**\\n```lean\\n/-- Verification status for badge display -/\\ninductive VerificationLevel\\n  | notStarted   -- No Lean code attached\\n  | inProgress   -- Has sorry or incomplete\\n  | verified     -- Fully proven\\n  deriving Inhabited, Repr\\n\\n/-- Determine verification level from node status string -/\\ndef toVerificationLevel (status : String) : VerificationLevel :=\\n  if status == \\\"proven\\\" || status == \\\"fullyProven\\\" || status == \\\"mathlibReady\\\" || status == \\\"inMathlib\\\" then\\n    .verified\\n  else if status == \\\"sorry\\\" || status == \\\"stated\\\" || status == \\\"ready\\\" then\\n    .inProgress\\n  else\\n    .notStarted\\n```\\n\\n**Where Badges are Currently Inserted in Theorem Statements (lines 127-143):**\\n```lean\\n/-- Render theorem environment (statement only) -/\\ndef renderStatement (info : PaperNodeInfo) : Html :=\\n  .tag \\\"div\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", s!\\\"paper-theorem paper-{info.envType}\\\"),\\n               (\\\"id\\\", info.label)] (\\n    .tag \\\"div\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", \\\"paper-theorem-header\\\")] (\\n      .tag \\\"span\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", \\\"paper-theorem-type\\\")] (\\n        Html.text true (capitalize info.envType ++ \\\" \\\" ++ info.displayNumber)\\n      ) ++\\n      renderBadge info.status ++                      -- BADGE INSERTED HERE (line 134)\\n      (match info.blueprintUrl with\\n       | some url => .tag \\\"a\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", \\\"blueprint-link\\\"), (\\\"href\\\", url)]\\n                       (Html.text true \\\"[blueprint]\\\")\\n       | none => Html.empty)\\n    ) ++\\n    .tag \\\"div\\\" #[(\\\"class\\\", \\\"paper-theorem-statement\\\")] (\\n      Html.text false info.statement  -- Raw LaTeX for MathJax\\n    )\\n  )\\n```\\n\\n**How Status Data Flows Through:**\\n\\n1. **NodeInfo structure** contains the status (line 376):\\n   ```lean\\n   def toPaperNodeInfo (node : NodeInfo) (baseUrl : String := \\\"\\\") : PaperNodeInfo :=\\n     { label := node.label\\n       envType := node.envType\\n       displayNumber := node.displayNumber.getD node.label\\n       statement := latexToHtml node.statementHtml\\n       proof := node.proofHtml.map latexToHtml\\n       status := nodeStatusToVerificationLevel node.status    -- STATUS CONVERTED HERE (line 376)\\n       blueprintUrl := some (baseUrl ++ node.fullUrl)\\n     }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Manifest/Ledger Integration** (line 358-363):\\n   ```lean\\n   /-- Convert NodeStatus to VerificationLevel -/\\n   def nodeStatusToVerificationLevel (status : NodeStatus) : VerificationLevel :=\\n     match status with\\n     | .proven | .fullyProven | .mathlibReady => .verified\\n     | .sorry | .ready => .inProgress\\n     | .notReady => .notStarted\\n   ```\\n\\n   `NodeStatus` is imported from `Dress.Graph` (line 26) and comes from the Dress manifest which is populated during the build.\\n\\n3. **NodeInfo Data Source:**\\n   The `NodeInfo` comes from a `HashMap String NodeInfo` (artifacts) that's passed to `blockToHtmlString` (line 419) which resolves `\\\\paperStatement`, `\\\\paperFull`, and `\\\\paperProof` hooks.\\n\\n**Entry Points Where Badges Are Applied:**\\n- Line 127: `renderStatement` - basic statement rendering (badges included)\\n- Line 151: `renderFull` - statement + proof (uses renderStatement which includes badge)\\n- Line 146: `renderStatementSbs` - side-by-side rendering (converts to SbsData)\\n- Line 162: `renderFullSbs` - side-by-side full rendering\\n\\n**The Complete Badge HTML Class Names (from Paper.lean lines 78):**\\n- `.verification-badge` (wrapper)\\n- `.verified` / `.in-progress` / `.not-started` (status class)\\n- `.badge-icon` + `.badge-icon-{check|half|circle}` (icon class)\\n- `.badge-text` (text label)\\n\\n**Related CSS Classes Expected:** Based on criteria.py, these CSS variable classes should exist:\\n- Status colors are defined in Dress/Graph/Svg.lean (line 114 in CLAUDE.md)\\n- CSS in common.css should use variables matching the 6-status color m",

Section 2 (Dual Authoring): Reframe Verso as future capability, TeX as primary MVP mode\n  - Section 3 (Dependency Graph): Remove \"filter controls\" -- keep \"pan, zoom, and fit controls\"\n  - Visual Standards: Replace \"responsive layout for various screen sizes\" with \"desktop/landscape layout\"\n  - Visual Standards: Replace \"system preference detection\" with \"manual dark/light toggle with system preference fallback\"\n  - Add new section for #68: \"Interactive Components & Design Consistency\" covering toggles, modals, navigation, design language\n  - Success Criteria: Update criterion 2 (both authoring modes) to reflect TeX-primary\n  - Add to \"What MVP Does NOT Include\": mobile/responsive layout, verso-native document generation (future)\n- Changes to CLAUDE.md:\n  - Known Limitations > Verso LaTeX Export: Clarify that `paper_verso`, `blueprint_verso`, and `pdf_verso` are all removed from active surfaces (not just `pdf_verso`)\n  - Update sidebar description if it references verso\n\n**Agent 1B: Verso removal from code**\n- Files (all in `dev/scripts/sbs/`):\n  - `tests/compliance/mapping.py`: Remove `\"verso\"` from REPO_PAGE_MAPPING (line 39), REPO_VALIDATOR_MAPPING (line 64), and `paper_verso`/`blueprint_verso` from ALL_PAGES (lines 93-94)\n  - `tests/compliance/criteria.py`: Delete PAPER_VERSO_CRITERIA (lines 372-390), BLUEPRINT_VERSO_CRITERIA (lines 393-434), remove from PAGE_CRITERIA dict (lines 565-566)\n  - `tests/compliance/capture.py`: Remove verso from DEFAULT_PAGES (lines 37-38), exclude_patterns (lines 61-62), starting_pages (line 69)\n  - `tests/validators/design/toggle_discoverability.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 98)\n  - `tests/validators/design/jarring_check.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 84)\n  - `tests/validators/design/professional_score.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 95)\n\n### Wave 2: Sidebar + Theme (2 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent 2A: Remove verso from sidebar (Lean)**\n- File: `toolchain/Runway/Runway/Theme.lean`\n- Change: Remove the verso section from the `navItems` array (line 198):\n  - Delete: `++ #[sectionHeader \"Verso\", separator, versoBlueprint, versoPaperRow]`\n  - Keep the variable definitions (lines 168-171) but unused -- or delete them too for cleanliness\n- Also remove the TeX section header label since there's no longer a distinction needed:\n  - Change `sectionHeader \"TeX\"` to just remove the section header, OR keep it if the user wants explicit \"TeX\" labeling\n- Verify: `lean_diagnostic_messages` after edit to confirm no compilation errors\n\n**Agent 2B: System theme preference detection**\n- File: `toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/plastex.js`\n  - Replace `getPreferredTheme()` (lines 3-11) to check `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` when no localStorage preference exists\n  - Add `matchMedia` change listener (after line 38) that applies system preference changes only when no saved preference\n- File: `toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/common.css`\n  - Add `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { html:not([data-theme]) { ... } }` block reusing existing dark mode variable definitions as fallback for initial page load before JS runs\n\n### Wave 3: Badges Investigation + Design Language (2 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent 3A: Verification badge investigation**\n- Paper.lean already has `renderBadge` (line 72-82), `VerificationLevel` (lines 49-63), and badge insertion in `renderStatement` (line 134)\n- **Investigation needed:** Why aren't badges appearing in generated paper HTML?\n  - Check if `\\paperstatement` LaTeX command actually calls `renderStatement` during HTML generation\n  - Check if the paper generation path uses `PaperNodeInfo` with populated status\n  - Check if the manifest/artifacts HashMap is being passed correctly to `blockToHtmlString`\n  - Build SBS-Test and inspect `paper_tex.html` for `.verification-badge` elements\n- If code path is broken: fix the plumbing (likely in `blockToHtmlString` or `replacePlaceholders`)\n- If code works but CSS isn't rendering: fix CSS in `paper.css` or `common.css`\n\n**Agent 3B: Design language consistency fixes**\n- Build SBS-Test, capture screenshots with `sbs capture --project SBSTest --interactive`\n- Visual audit all pages for:\n  - Color mismatches (elements that should use CSS variables but don't)\n  - Link styling artifacts (hooks/serifs on links in key declarations)\n  - Inconsistent spacing, font sizes, or padding between page types\n  - Any elements that look out of place\n- Fix identified issues in `common.css`, `blueprint.css`, `paper.css`, `dep_graph.css`\n- Re-capture and verify fixes\n\n### Wave 4: Build + Validate\n\n- Build SBS-Test: `python build.py`\n- Capture screenshots: `sbs capture --project SBSTest --interactive`\n- Run evergreen tests: `sbs_run_tests(tier=\"evergreen\")`\n- Run validators: `sbs_validate_project(\"SBSTest\", [\"T5\", \"T6\"])`\n- Verify: no verso in sidebar screenshots, badges in paper, theme respects system preference\n\n## Files Modified (by repo)\n\n| Repo | Files | Agent |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Side-By-Side-Blueprint (main) | `dev/markdowns/living/MVP.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | 1A |\n| Side-By-Side-Blueprint (scripts) | 6 files in `dev/scripts/sbs/tests/` | 1B |\n| Runway | `Runway/Theme.lean` | 2A |\n| Runway | `Runway/Paper.lean` (if fix needed) | 3A |\n| dress-blueprint-action | `assets/plastex.js`, `assets/common.css` | 2B |\n\nNo file overlaps between parallel agents within a wave.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. **Verso removed:** Sidebar screenshots show no \"Verso\" section\n2. **Theme preference:** Open site with system dark mode \u2192 should render dark without manual toggle\n3. **Badges:** `paper_tex.html` contains `.verification-badge` elements with correct status classes\n4. **Design consistency:** Visual audit confirms no color mismatches or styling artifacts\n5. **Tests pass:** Evergreen tier at 100%\n6. **T5 >= 1.0, T6 >= 0.9:** Quality validators pass gates\n"

Section 2 (Dual Authoring): Reframe Verso as future capability, TeX as primary MVP mode\n  - Section 3 (Dependency Graph): Remove \"filter controls\" -- keep \"pan, zoom, and fit controls\"\n  - Visual Standards: Replace \"responsive layout for various screen sizes\" with \"desktop/landscape layout\"\n  - Visual Standards: Replace \"system preference detection\" with \"manual dark/light toggle with system preference fallback\"\n  - Add new section for #68: \"Interactive Components & Design Consistency\" covering toggles, modals, navigation, design language\n  - Add explicit requirement: **no horizontal scrollbars** -- all content (especially side-by-side displays) must fit within the viewport width\n  - Add explicit requirement: **hover tooltips must be bounded** -- max-width constraint, consistent styling with overall design language\n  - Success Criteria: Update criterion 2 (both authoring modes) to reflect TeX-primary\n  - Add to \"What MVP Does NOT Include\": mobile/responsive layout, verso-native document generation (future)\n- Changes to CLAUDE.md:\n  - Known Limitations > Verso LaTeX Export: Clarify that `paper_verso`, `blueprint_verso`, and `pdf_verso` are all removed from active surfaces (not just `pdf_verso`)\n  - Update sidebar description if it references verso\n\n**Agent 1B: Verso removal from code**\n- Files (all in `dev/scripts/sbs/`):\n  - `tests/compliance/mapping.py`: Remove `\"verso\"` from REPO_PAGE_MAPPING (line 39), REPO_VALIDATOR_MAPPING (line 64), and `paper_verso`/`blueprint_verso` from ALL_PAGES (lines 93-94)\n  - `tests/compliance/criteria.py`: Delete PAPER_VERSO_CRITERIA (lines 372-390), BLUEPRINT_VERSO_CRITERIA (lines 393-434), remove from PAGE_CRITERIA dict (lines 565-566)\n  - `tests/compliance/capture.py`: Remove verso from DEFAULT_PAGES (lines 37-38), exclude_patterns (lines 61-62), starting_pages (line 69)\n  - `tests/validators/design/toggle_discoverability.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 98)\n  - `tests/validators/design/jarring_check.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 84)\n  - `tests/validators/design/professional_score.py`: Remove `blueprint_verso` from DEFAULT_PAGES (line 95)\n\n### Wave 2: Sidebar + Theme (2 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent 2A: Remove verso from sidebar (Lean)**\n- File: `toolchain/Runway/Runway/Theme.lean`\n- Change: Remove the verso section from the `navItems` array (line 198):\n  - Delete: `++ #[sectionHeader \"Verso\", separator, versoBlueprint, versoPaperRow]`\n  - Keep the variable definitions (lines 168-171) but unused -- or delete them too for cleanliness\n- Also remove the TeX section header label since there's no longer a distinction needed:\n  - Change `sectionHeader \"TeX\"` to just remove the section header, OR keep it if the user wants explicit \"TeX\" labeling\n- Verify: `lean_diagnostic_messages` after edit to confirm no compilation errors\n\n**Agent 2B: System theme preference detection**\n- File: `toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/plastex.js`\n  - Replace `getPreferredTheme()` (lines 3-11) to check `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` when no localStorage preference exists\n  - Add `matchMedia` change listener (after line 38) that applies system preference changes only when no saved preference\n- File: `toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/common.css`\n  - Add `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { html:not([data-theme]) { ... } }` block reusing existing dark mode variable definitions as fallback for initial page load before JS runs\n\n### Wave 3: Badges Investigation + Design Language (2 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent 3A: Verification badge investigation**\n- Paper.lean already has `renderBadge` (line 72-82), `VerificationLevel` (lines 49-63), and badge insertion in `renderStatement` (line 134)\n- **Investigation needed:** Why aren't badges appearing in generated paper HTML?\n  - Check if `\\paperstatement` LaTeX command actually calls `renderStatement` during HTML generation\n  - Check if the paper generation path uses `PaperNodeInfo` with populated status\n  - Check if the manifest/artifacts HashMap is being passed correctly to `blockToHtmlString`\n  - Build SBS-Test and inspect `paper_tex.html` for `.verification-badge` elements\n- If code path is broken: fix the plumbing (likely in `blockToHtmlString` or `replacePlaceholders`)\n- If code works but CSS isn't rendering: fix CSS in `paper.css` or `common.css`\n\n**Agent 3B: Design language consistency + overflow fixes**\n- Build SBS-Test, capture screenshots with `sbs capture --project SBSTest --interactive`\n- **Priority fix 1: No horizontal scrollbars**\n  - Side-by-side displays (`.decl-container`, `.sbs-display`, or similar) must not overflow viewport\n  - Investigate CSS causing horizontal overflow -- likely fixed-width columns or `pre` blocks without `overflow-wrap`\n  - Fix: ensure `max-width: 100%`, `overflow-x: auto` on code blocks (not the page), `word-break: break-word` where needed\n  - Apply to chapter pages and any page with side-by-side content\n- **Priority fix 2: Hover tooltip max-width**\n  - Lean hover tooltips (Tippy.js, `.tippy-box` or `.lean-hover`) are unbounded in width\n  - Fix: add `max-width` constraint (e.g., `max-width: 600px` or `max-width: 50vw`)\n  - Ensure long type signatures wrap properly within the tooltip\n  - Match tooltip styling (border, background, font) to overall design language\n  - Files: likely `common.css` or `verso-code.js` (Tippy.js config) in `dress-blueprint-action/assets/`\n- **Visual audit:**\n  - Color mismatches (elements that should use CSS variables but don't)\n  - Link styling artifacts (hooks/serifs on links in key declarations)\n  - Inconsistent spacing, font sizes, or padding between page types\n- Fix identified issues in `common.css`, `blueprint.css`, `paper.css`\n- Re-capture and verify fixes\n\n### Wave 4: Build + Validate\n\n- Build SBS-Test: `python build.py`\n- Capture screenshots: `sbs capture --project SBSTest --interactive`\n- Run evergreen tests: `sbs_run_tests(tier=\"evergreen\")`\n- Run validators: `sbs_validate_project(\"SBSTest\", [\"T5\", \"T6\"])`\n- Verify: no verso in sidebar screenshots, badges in paper, theme respects system preference\n\n## Files Modified (by repo)\n\n| Repo | Files | Agent |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Side-By-Side-Blueprint (main) | `dev/markdowns/living/MVP.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | 1A |\n| Side-By-Side-Blueprint (scripts) | 6 files in `dev/scripts/sbs/tests/` | 1B |\n| Runway | `Runway/Theme.lean` | 2A |\n| Runway | `Runway/Paper.lean` (if fix needed) | 3A |\n| dress-blueprint-action | `assets/plastex.js`, `assets/common.css` | 2B, 3B |\n\nNo file overlaps between parallel agents within a wave.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. **Verso removed:** Sidebar screenshots show no \"Verso\" section\n2. **Theme preference:** Open site with system dark mode \u2192 should render dark without manual toggle\n3. **Badges:** `paper_tex.html` contains `.verification-badge` elements with correct status classes\n4. **No horizontal scrollbars:** All pages render without horizontal overflow at desktop width\n5. **Hover tooltips:** Lean hovers are bounded in width, text wraps cleanly\n6. **Design consistency:** Visual audit confirms no color mismatches or styling artifacts\n7. **Tests pass:** Evergreen tier at 100%\n6. **T5 >= 1.0, T6 >= 0.9:** Quality validators pass gates\n"

TeX is the primary MVP authoring mode. Keep the Verso description but clearly label it as \"Future\" or \"Planned\" -- not an MVP deliverable. The TeX mode section stays as-is.\n\n2. **Section 3 (Dependency Graph):** Change \"Pan, zoom, and filter controls\" to \"Pan, zoom, and fit controls\" -- filter controls don't exist.\n\n3. **Visual Standards section:** \n   - Replace \"Responsive layout for various screen sizes\" with \"Desktop/landscape layout optimized for wide screens\"\n   - Replace \"system preference detection\" with \"manual dark/light toggle with system preference fallback\"\n   - Add: \"No horizontal scrollbars -- all content, including side-by-side displays, must fit within the viewport width\"\n   - Add: \"Hover tooltips bounded in width with consistent styling\"\n\n4. **Add new section after Visual Standards (before Compatibility):** \"### 8. Interactive Components & Design Consistency\"\n   Contents:\n   - Working proof toggles (expand/collapse with synchronized LaTeX and Lean panels)\n   - Graph node modals with status, statement, and proof details\n   - Lean code hover tooltips with type signatures (bounded width, consistent styling)\n   - Theme toggle (dark/light) with localStorage persistence and system preference fallback\n   - Sidebar navigation across all page types (dashboard, graph, blueprint chapters, paper)\n   - Chapter prev/next navigation\n   - Design language consistency across all page types -- unified colors, typography, spacing\n\n5. **Section 6 (Paper Generation):** \n   - Change \"Supports both TeX and Verso authoring\" to \"Primary support for TeX authoring (Verso planned for future)\"\n   - Add: \"Verification badges showing formalization status (Verified, In Progress, Not Started) next to theorem statements\"\n\n6. **Success Criteria:** \n   - Criterion 2: Change \"Both authoring modes work - TeX and Verso documents render correctly\" to \"TeX authoring mode works - TeX documents render correctly (Verso planned)\"\n   - Add criterion 9: \"Interactive components work - Toggles, modals, hovers, navigation all functional\"\n   - Add criterion 10: \"Design consistency - No horizontal scrollbars, no visual artifacts, cohesive design language\"\n\n7. **\"What MVP Does NOT Include\" section:** Add:\n   - Mobile/tablet responsive layout (desktop-only)\n   - Verso-native document generation (planned for future)\n   - Dependency graph filter controls\n\n8. **Renumber sections** if needed (the new section 8 means old sections 7+ shift).\n\n### File 2: `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/CLAUDE.md`\n\nFind the \"Known Limitations\" section and update:\n\n1. **Verso LaTeX Export subsection:** Change from saying only `pdf_verso` was removed to clearly state that ALL verso page types (`paper_verso`, `blueprint_verso`, `pdf_verso`) are removed from active surfaces (sidebar, compliance, validation). Lean infrastructure is preserved for future use.\n\n2. **Dashboard Layout subsection:** Keep as-is (already accurate).\n\n3. If the sidebar description elsewhere in CLAUDE.md mentions verso items, add a note that verso items have been removed from the sidebar.\n\n### Git\nAfter making changes, commit on the current branch:\n```\ngit add dev/markdowns/living/MVP.md CLAUDE.md\ngit commit -m \"docs: sync MVP.md with reality, update CLAUDE.md known limitations\n\n- Reframe Verso as future capability, TeX as primary MVP mode\n- Desktop-only scope (no mobile/responsive)\n- Drop filter controls claim, add fit controls\n- Add #68 requirements: interactive components, design consistency\n- Add no-horizontal-scrollbar and bounded-tooltip requirements\n- Add verification badges to paper generation requirements\n- Fix CLAUDE.md verso removal documentation accuracy\"\n```"

The current `getPreferredTheme()` function (around lines 3-11) always defaults to 'light' when no localStorage preference exists. It looks like:\n```javascript\nfunction getPreferredTheme() {\n  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('sbs-theme');\n  if (savedTheme) {\n    return savedTheme;\n  }\n  return 'light';\n}\n```\n\nChange it to check system preference as fallback:\n```javascript\nfunction getPreferredTheme() {\n  const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('sbs-theme');\n  if (savedTheme) {\n    return savedTheme;\n  }\n  if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {\n    return 'dark';\n  }\n  return 'light';\n}\n```\n\nAlso find the comment about system preference listener being disabled (around lines 33-34) and replace it with an active listener:\n```javascript\n// Listen for system theme changes (only applies when no saved preference)\nif (window.matchMedia) {\n  window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', function(e) {\n    if (!localStorage.getItem('sbs-theme')) {\n      applyTheme(e.matches ? 'dark' : 'light');\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**File 2: `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/common.css`**\n\nRead the file. Find the `html[data-theme=\"dark\"]` block (around line 250). After the existing dark mode block ends, add a CSS-only fallback for the brief moment before JS runs:\n\n```css\n/* System preference fallback -- applies before JS sets data-theme attribute */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  html:not([data-theme]) {\n    --sbs-bg-page: #252525;\n    --sbs-bg-surface: #1a1a1a;\n    --sbs-bg-card: #2d2d2d;\n    --sbs-text: #f0f0f0;\n    --sbs-text-muted: #cccccc;\n    --sbs-border: #cccccc;\n    --sbs-link: #60a5fa;\n    --sbs-link-hover: #93c5fd;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCopy the most critical variables from the `html[data-theme=\"dark\"]` block. Don't duplicate all of them -- just the ones that would cause visible flash (backgrounds, text, links, borders). This prevents FOUC (flash of unstyled content) on dark-mode systems.\n\n### Git\nAfter changes:\n```\ncd /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action\ngit add assets/plastex.js assets/common.css\ngit commit -m \"feat: add system theme preference detection with prefers-color-scheme\n\n- Check window.matchMedia for dark preference when no localStorage saved\n- Add listener for system theme changes (respects saved preference)\n- Add CSS @media fallback to prevent FOUC on dark-mode systems\n\nRefs #68\"\n```"

The CSS classes (`.verification-badge`, `.verified`, `.in-progress`, `.not-started`) exist in `paper.css` and `common.css`.\n\n### Investigation Steps\n\n1. **Read Paper.lean** (`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Runway/Runway/Paper.lean`) thoroughly\n2. **Trace the code path:** How does a `\\paperstatement{label}` in LaTeX get processed?\n   - The LaTeX parser in `Runway/Latex/Parser.lean` or `ToHtml.lean` handles `\\paperstatement`\n   - It should call into Paper.lean's rendering functions\n   - The rendering function should produce HTML with badge markup\n3. **Check if the code path is actually exercised:**\n   - Look at how `blockToHtmlString` or `replacePlaceholders` resolves paper commands\n   - Check if `PaperNodeInfo` has populated `status` field when the function runs\n   - Look at whether the manifest/artifacts HashMap is threaded to the paper rendering path\n\n4. **Build SBS-Test and check output:**\n   ```bash\n   cd /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/SBS-Test\n   python3 ../../dev/scripts/build.py\n   ```\n   Then grep the output for verification-badge:\n   ```bash\n   grep -c \"verification-badge\" /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/SBS-Test/.lake/build/runway/paper_tex.html\n   ```\n\n5. **If badges are missing from output:** Find where the code path breaks and fix it. Common issues:\n   - The paper generation might use a different code path that bypasses `renderStatement`\n   - The artifacts HashMap might not be passed to the paper rendering context\n   - The `\\paperstatement` command might produce raw HTML without going through `renderStatement`\n\n6. **If badges ARE in the output but not visible:** Check CSS in `paper.css` and `common.css` for display issues.\n\n### Important\n- This involves Lean code in the Runway repo\n- After any Lean edits, verify with `lean_diagnostic_messages`\n- Building SBS-Test takes ~2 minutes\n\n### Git\nIf fixes are needed, commit in the Runway submodule:\n```\ncd /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Runway\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"fix: ensure verification badges render in paper HTML output\n\n<describe what was broken and how it was fixed>\n\nRefs #68\"\n```"

The actual rendering flow was:\\n\\n1. `\\\\paperstatement{label}` in LaTeX is parsed as `.paperStatement`\\n2. `blockToHtmlString` matches `.paperStatement` and calls `renderStatementSbs`\\n3. `renderStatementSbs` calls `Dress.Render.renderSideBySide` with `.paper` variant\\n4. `renderSideBySide` calls `renderLatexColumnPaper`\\n5. `renderLatexColumnPaper` only rendered a **status dot** (`<span class=\\\"status-dot paper-status-dot\\\" ...>`), not a verification badge\\n\\nThe `renderStatement` function in Paper.lean (which DID call `renderBadge`) was never used -- the SBS variants (`renderStatementSbs`, `renderFullSbs`) were always called instead, and they delegated to `Dress.Render.renderSideBySide`.\\n\\n## Fix Applied\\n\\n**File:** `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/Dress/Dress/Render/SideBySide.lean`\\n\\nAdded 4 new functions:\\n- `statusToBadgeClass` -- Maps `NodeStatus` to CSS class (`verified`, `in-progress`, `not-started`)\\n- `statusToBadgeLabel` -- Maps `NodeStatus` to display text\\n- `statusToBadgeIcon` -- Maps `NodeStatus` to icon class suffix\\n- `renderVerificationBadge` -- Produces badge HTML matching `.verification-badge` CSS in `paper.css`\\n\\nModified `renderLatexColumnPaper` to:\\n- Replace the status dot with a verification badge\\n- Remove the now-unused `statusColor`/`statusTitle` variables\\n\\nThe fix is in commit `271a72d` in the Dress repo, auto-committed by `build.py`.

This is the star feature and it must not have scrollbars.\n\n1. Read the CSS files that control side-by-side display layout:\n   - `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/common.css`\n   - `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/blueprint.css`\n\n2. Look for classes like `.decl-container`, `.sbs-display`, `.lean-decl`, `.statement-panel`, `.proof-panel`, `.lean-proof-body`, or similar that define the side-by-side layout. Use sbs_oracle_query to find relevant class names.\n\n3. The fix should ensure:\n   - The overall page never has horizontal scrollbar (`overflow-x: hidden` on body/main content is a last resort)\n   - Side-by-side columns use `max-width: 100%` or flexible widths\n   - Code blocks within panels use `overflow-x: auto` (scroll within the code block, not the page)\n   - Long identifiers wrap appropriately: `overflow-wrap: break-word` or `word-break: break-all` on code elements\n   - `pre` elements have `max-width: 100%; overflow-x: auto` so they scroll internally\n\n### Priority Fix 2: Hover Tooltip Max-Width\n\nThe Lean hover tooltips (powered by Tippy.js) are unbounded in width and display very wide type signatures that look sloppy. See the screenshot description: tooltips extending across the full viewport width.\n\n1. Read `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/toolchain/dress-blueprint-action/assets/verso-code.js` to find the Tippy.js configuration\n2. Read the CSS for tooltip styling in `common.css`\n3. Fix:\n   - Add `max-width: 600px` (or `max-width: 50vw`) to the Tippy.js configuration or CSS\n   - Ensure text wraps within the tooltip: `word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word`\n   - Match tooltip colors/borders/fonts to the overall design language (use CSS variables)\n\nLook for Tippy configuration like:\n```javascript\ntippy(element, {\n  // add maxWidth here\n  maxWidth: 600,\n  ...\n})\n```\n\nOr add CSS:\n```css\n.tippy-box {\n  max-width: 600px !important;\n}\n```\n\n### Visual Audit\n\nAfter the above fixes, check for:\n- **Link styling artifacts:** The user mentioned \"hooks on the end of links\" in key declarations on the dashboard. Look at link styles in `common.css` or `blueprint.css` -- likely `text-decoration` or `border-bottom` creating visual hooks.

Execute all parts sequentially.\n\n### Context from the completed /task session\n\nThe task addressed issues #68 and #109:\n- **#68:** Expand MVP requirements with interactive components, navigation, design language consistency\n- **#109:** Desktop-only focus + remove verso-native generation from surfaces\n\n**What was done (4 waves, 8 agents):**\n1. MVP.md rewritten: desktop-only, verso as future capability, added interactive components + design consistency sections, no-horizontal-scrollbar and bounded-tooltip requirements\n2. CLAUDE.md known limitations updated for verso accuracy\n3. Verso removed from: sidebar (Theme.lean), compliance mapping/criteria, validators, tests (6 Python files)\n4. System theme preference detection added (plastex.js + common.css prefers-color-scheme)\n5. Verification badges fixed: found renderBadge was dead code, added badge rendering to SideBySide.lean in Dress repo\n6. Design language: tooltip max-width 600px, side-by-side grid changed to 1fr 1fr, link styling fixes, overflow-wrap on LaTeX column\n7. All evergreen tests pass (629/629), T5=100%, T6=91.4%\n\n**Session observations for retrospective:**\n- User interrupted twice during exploration (once to redirect focus, once accidental)\n- User added two requirements mid-planning (horizontal scrollbars, hover tooltip width) that weren't in original issues\n- Badge investigation revealed dead code -- the renderBadge function existed but was never called from the actual rendering path\n- The T6 validator reports `passed: false` at 91.4% despite our gate threshold being >= 0.9 (90%) -- this is issue #115\n- 6 test failures after verso removal were from test assertions still referencing verso pages\n- The task used all 4 agent slots in waves 1-3 efficiently with no file collisions\n\n### Part -1: Session Retrospective\n\nWrite a retrospective to `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/storage/archive/retrospectives/1770170870.md` covering the 5 analysis dimensions:\n\n1. **User Orchestration:** User was directive and efficient. Added scope mid-planning (scrollbars + tooltips) -- these were valid additions discovered during visual review. Used multiple-choice format effectively. Two interruptions were minor.\n\n2. **Claude Alignment:** Initial exploration agents returned comprehensive but partially redundant findings (all 4 reported badge CSS exists). The badge investigation required a build to determine the code path was broken -- could have been caught earlier by checking the actual rendering path rather than just verifying the function exists.\n\n3. **System Design:** T6 validator threshold mismatch (issue #115) caused confusion -- validator says `passed: false` but our gate threshold would accept 91.4%. The archive's gate checker correctly used plan thresholds.\n\n4. **Plan Execution:** Plan was followed closely. The only mid-flight adjustment was adding 2 requirements during planning (not execution). Wave structure worked well -- no collisions, clear separation of concerns. Badge fix required building SBS-Test which added time to Wave 3.\n\n5. **Meta-Observations:** Dead code detection (renderBadge) highlights a gap -- we had code that appeared complete but was never exercised. Test assertions referencing removed features is a recurring pattern when removing features.\n\n### Parts 0-4: README check, core docs, oracle regen, porcelain, archive\n\nAfter the retrospective, proceed through the remaining parts:\n\n1. Run `python3 -m sbs readme-check --json` to check staleness\n2. Update READMEs only for changed repos (skip if none changed)\n3. Sync core documentation if needed\n4. Regenerate oracle: `python3 -m sbs oracle compile`\n5. Ensure porcelain state\n6. Close epoch with `python3 -m sbs archive upload --trigger skill --state-transition phase_end`\n\n### Archive transitions\nExecute the required archive uploads between each part transition. Working directory for all sbs commands: `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/scripts`\n\n### Important\n- This runs autonomously to completion\n- Each part transition needs an archive upload\n- The final archive upload must use `--state-transition phase_end` to close the epoch\n- Do not skip the retrospective -- it runs first while context is hot"

It shows the GCR dashboard, but at the top there's a wide hover/tooltip popup that extends beyond the content area - it shows what appears to be a Lean type signature that's extremely wide:\n\n\"Crystallographic.IntegerMatrixOrders (N : \u2115) : Set \u2115\"\n\nAnd below it there's a tooltip that's very wide with lots of text about the definition. This hover popup is clearly too wide and extends past the viewport, creating a visually jarring experience.\n\nI also notice the sidebar shows \"Verso\" section (with \"Blueprint\" greyed out and \"Paper_web [Verso]\" items), confirming the verso removal need.\n \nI need to add two more items to the plan: preventing horizontal scrollbars by ensuring content fits within the viewport width, and constraining hover popup widths with better styling. These fit into Wave 3B alongside the other design language improvements.",

Fixed by adding badge rendering functions to `SideBySide.lean` and replacing status dots with verification badges. 6 badges now render in paper_tex.html.\n\n2. **Agent 3B (Design):** Found that many fixes were already applied (grid changed to 1fr 1fr, Tippy maxWidth set to 600, pre overflow-x: auto). Added additional fixes for LaTeX column overflow-wrap and cleaner link styling with visited states and text-underline-offset.\n\n\n3. **Wave 4:** Moving into the build and validation phase -- I'll compile SBS-Test, run the test suite, and verify everything passes the gates.",
