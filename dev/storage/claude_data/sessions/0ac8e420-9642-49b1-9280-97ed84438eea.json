He estimates ~1000 definitions needed to state all big new theorems. His specific test case: \"connected reductive group over a field\" \u2014 which he tried to formalize with Andrew Yang and got stuck immediately due to design decisions.\n\n**Kevin's RenPhil project**: Formalizing statements of recent Annals papers. The bottleneck is not proofs but definitions.\n\n**Brian Conrad's guidance to Kevin** (quoted in thread): The right definition is \"G is k-smooth and the unipotent radical of G_{kbar} is trivial\" \u2014 or shortcut: \"G_{kbar} has no nontrivial smooth connected unipotent normal closed k-subgroup.\"\n\n## Why This Showcase\n\nThe user announced SBS in [#announce > Side-by-side blueprint](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113486-announce/topic/Side-by-side.20blueprint.20-.20Experience.20prototype) and wants to demonstrate SBS's value to Kevin specifically. Kevin is a pillar of the Lean community and (justifiably) hard to impress.\n\n**The pitch**: SBS as a tool for visualizing definition dependencies \u2014 showing exactly what's missing between mathlib and cutting-edge number theory.

He estimates ~1000 definitions needed to state all big new theorems. His specific test case: \"connected reductive group over a field\" \u2014 which he tried to formalize with Andrew Yang and got stuck immediately due to design decisions.\n\n**Kevin's RenPhil project**: Formalizing statements of recent Annals papers. The bottleneck is not proofs but definitions.\n\n**Brian Conrad's guidance to Kevin** (quoted in thread): The right definition is \"G is k-smooth and the unipotent radical of G_{kbar} is trivial\" \u2014 or shortcut: \"G_{kbar} has no nontrivial smooth connected unipotent normal closed k-subgroup.\"\n\n## Why This Showcase\n\nThe user announced SBS in [#announce > Side-by-side blueprint](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/113486-announce/topic/Side-by-side.20blueprint.20-.20Experience.20prototype) and wants to demonstrate SBS's value to Kevin specifically. Kevin is a pillar of the Lean community and (justifiably) hard to impress.\n\n**The pitch**: SBS as a tool for visualizing definition dependencies \u2014 showing exactly what's missing between mathlib and cutting-edge number theory.

      "content": "Okay, so I have a lot of context now. The announcement got some nice responses (Ya\u00ebl Dillies asking about VS Code integration, Alex Kontorovich chiming in about local builds).\n\nThe sloplib thread is fascinating and reveals a lot about Kevin Buzzard's thinking:\n\n1. **Kevin's RenPhil project**: He's working on formal statements of recent Annals papers. The bottleneck is missing definitions.\n\n2. **The \"sloplib\" concept**: A fork of mathlib where AI-generated code is accepted with lower standards - proofs 10x as long, poorly maintained, but sorry-free. The question is whether this could accelerate progress toward stating and proving things that mathlib can't yet express.\n\n3. **Kevin's specific challenge**: He wants to formalize \"connected reductive group over a field\" and automorphic forms. This is extremely complex - he shared Brian Conrad's detailed response about the definition difficulties.\n\n4. **Kim Morrison's suggestion**: Kevin should write prompts at three levels (minimal, with references, detailed explanation) and Kim will test them with various AI tools (Aristotle, Claude, Codex).\n\n5. **Key insight**: Kevin says \"I don't know how I would like it done\" - the design decisions are genuinely hard. Should it be a Hopf algebra or a scheme? What's the right definition of \"reductive\"?\n\nNow, for a third showcase repo that could impress Kevin Buzzard:\n\n**What Kevin cares about (from the threads):**\n1. Acceleration toward stating big theorems (especially Langlands program)\n2. Missing definitions being the bottleneck\n3. The question of whether AI can help with hard design decisions\n4. Formalizing statements from recent Annals papers\n\n**What SBS offers that could be relevant:**\n1. Visual dependency graphs - catch logical errors\n2. Side-by-side display - see Lean alongside mathematical statements\n3. Dashboard - track progress on complex formalizations\n4. Blueprint structure - organize dependencies\n\n\n5. A few concrete directions emerge: I could build a \"Formal Statements\" showcase that maps out the dependency structure needed for Annals theorems without proving them, just visualizing what definitions are missing. Or create a \"Sloplib Experiment\" scaffold that uses SBS to manage AI-generated proofs, tracking completion status and flagging definitions needing human review. A third option is scaffolding the \"Connected Reductive Groups\" structure Kevin outlined, with the affine group scheme and unipotent radical as starting points.\n\nI could also pick recent Annals papers and create blueprints for stating their main theorems, or frame SBS as a tool for exploring alternative definition approaches\u2014Kevin mentioned trying multiple strategies for schemes and group cohomology, and the dependency graph could help visualize those design choices. The key insight is that while I can't complete Kevin's full vision, I can build something that demonstrates SBS capabilities while moving in a direction he cares about, especially given how missing definitions are the real bottleneck and how AI-generated proofs need human review for correctness.\n\nThe most persuasive approach would connect to Kevin's actual work in Langlands and number theory, use SBS to organize complex definitional dependencies, show how visual tools enable \"sloplib-style\" exploration, and strike a balance between ambition and feasibility. I should present these options to him.",

Made a clear recommendation: **Option D (Reductive Groups)** because:\n   - It's a prerequisite for Option A anyway\n   - Better reference materials\n   - Stronger mathlib foundation\n   - Natural fit for SBS visualization\n   - Directly addresses Kevin's explicit bottleneck\n\nThis is exactly the kind of analysis the user asked for. Let me summarize this for the user.",
