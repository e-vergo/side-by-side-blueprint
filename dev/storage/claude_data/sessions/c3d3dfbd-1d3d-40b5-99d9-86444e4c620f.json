Timing baseline metrics (current iteration time breakdown)\n2. Top 3-5 optimization opportunities ranked by impact vs effort\n3. Concrete proposals ready to spawn as follow-up issues\n4. Prioritization framework for implementation order\n\n## Execution Plan\n\n### Wave 1: Baseline Timing Analysis (4 parallel agents)\n\n**Agent A: Archive Timing Extraction**\n- Query recent archive entries (last 50-100) for converge skill sessions\n- Extract timing breakdowns from `archive_timing` fields\n- Compute percentiles (p50, p90, p95) for each operation category\n- Output: `archive_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent B: Build Timing Analysis**\n- Analyze build logs from `dev/storage/{project}/build_logs/`\n- Extract Lake build times, artifact generation, screenshot capture\n- Identify projects with slowest builds\n- Detect incremental build effectiveness (cache hits vs full rebuilds)\n- Output: `build_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent C: Session JSONL Analysis**\n- Parse session JSONL files for converge-related sessions\n- Extract API latency patterns (time between tool calls)\n- Analyze agent decision patterns (thinking time, tool call sequences)\n- Quantify context usage (cache read ratios, prompt tokens)\n- Output: `session_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Agent D: Validator + Git Timing Analysis**\n- Parse validator logs for T1-T8 execution times\n- Extract pytest timing data (test discovery, execution, teardown)\n- Analyze git operation timings from archive entries (porcelain checks, commits, pushes)\n- Quantify iCloud sync overhead\n- Output: `validator_git_timing_analysis.json`\n\n**Validator:** All 4 agents complete successfully with JSON output files\n\n---\n\n### Wave 2: Opportunity Identification (1 agent)\n\n**Agent: Synthesis & Opportunity Analysis**\n- Load all 4 JSON outputs from Wave 1\n- Compute overall baseline: total iteration time, phase breakdown\n- Identify async opportunities:\n  - Operations that block user but could run in background\n  - Operations that could run in parallel\n  - Operations that could be deferred\n- Find redundant work:\n  - Unnecessary rebuilds (unchanged source)\n  - Redundant validations (same inputs)\n  - Repeated analysis (cached results available)\n- Calculate potential impact for each opportunity (time saved)\n- Output: `optimization_opportunities.md` with ranked list\n\n**Validator:** Markdown file contains baseline metrics + ranked opportunities\n\n---\n\n### Wave 3: Prioritization & Proposals (1 agent)\n\n**Agent: Concrete Proposals**\n- Review `optimization_opportunities.md`\n- Select top 3-5 opportunities balancing quick wins vs long-term impact\n- For each opportunity, draft:\n  - Concrete implementation proposal\n  - Estimated impact (time saved, UX improvement)\n  - Implementation complexity (effort estimate)\n  - Dependencies and risks\n  - Ready-to-spawn GitHub issue content\n- Create prioritization framework (decision matrix)\n- Output: `optimization_proposals.md` + draft issue content\n\n**Validator:** Proposals document contains actionable next steps\n\n---\n\n## Gates\n\n```yaml\ngates:\n  tests: none               # Investigation task, no test requirements\n  deliverables:\n    - baseline_metrics: present\n    - ranked_opportunities: 3-5 items minimum\n    - concrete_proposals: actionable and specific\n    - prioritization_framework: defined\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Baseline metrics quantify current state (iteration time breakdown)\n- Top 3-5 opportunities identified with estimated impact\n- Concrete proposals ready to spawn as follow-up issues\n- Prioritization framework enables implementation decisions\n- Quick wins highlighted (async operations, redundant work elimination)\n\n## Constraints\n- Preserve archival integrity (completeness, fidelity)\n- Validation gates cannot be weakened\n- User experience quality must not degrade\n- Creative solutions encouraged within these boundaries\n\n## Affected Components\n- `/converge` skill (primary)\n- `/task` skill (gate validation, phase transitions)\n- `/introspect` skill (async candidate)\n- `/update-and-archive` skill (async candidate)\n- Archive upload system (`dev/scripts/sbs/archive/upload.py`)\n- Build pipeline (`dev/scripts/build.py`)\n- Validator framework (`dev/scripts/sbs/validators/`)\n\n## Notes\n- First optimization effort focused on clock time\n- Many quick wins likely available (low-hanging fruit)\n- User example: running `/introspect N` in background during work\n- Pain point: accumulation of many waits, not single bottleneck\n- Target: 50%+ iteration time reduction + remove user-blocking waits\n"

CRITICAL MEASUREMENT BLIND SPOT:** 3 of 8 timing categories (`index_save`, `icloud_sync_launch`, `porcelain`) are **never persisted** to the archive. The `archive_timings` dict is attached to the entry at `upload.py` line ~618, inside the `index_save` context -- before `index_save`, `icloud_sync_launch`, and `porcelain` finish. This means the potentially slowest operations (git commit+push via `porcelain`) are invisible in the data.\\n\\n**2. Extraction dominates everything:** Of the 5 categories that ARE captured:\\n- `extraction` (Claude data extraction from `~/.claude`) accounts for **94.5% of total time**\\n- It is the dominant category in **100% of all 169 entries** (no exceptions)\\n- p50 = 3.77s, p90 = 4.11s, max = 4.62s\\n\\n**3. Everything else is noise:**\\n| Category | p50 | p90 | p95 | % of total |\\n|----------|-----|-----|-----|------------|\\n| extraction | 3.773s | 4.109s | 4.280s | 94.5% |\\n| tagging | 0.137s | 0.145s | 0.149s | 3.4% |\\n| repo_commits | 0.059s | 0.067s | 0.070s | 1.5% |\\n| quality_scores | 0.002s | 0.004s | 0.277s | 0.6% |\\n| gate_validation | 0.000s | 0.000s | 0.000s | 0.0% |\\n\\n**4. Total per-entry time:** p50 = 3.97s, p90 = 4.37s, p95 = 4.70s -- but this EXCLUDES index_save, iCloud sync, and porcelain.\\n\\n**5. Build triggers are slower:** Build-triggered entries have p50 = 4.58s vs skill-triggered entries at p50 = 3.91s, likely due to quality score validation overhead.\\n\\n**6.

PNT has no timing data in the ledger.\\n\\n2. **Full builds are expensive:** SBSTest 193s, GCR 253s. Dominated by `update_manifests` (82-91s, Lake dependency resolution) and `build_project` (58-100s, Lake build with BLUEPRINT_DRESS=1). Together these are 73-75% of full build time.\\n\\n3. **Incremental caching works well:** GCR incremental builds are 48-64s (4-5x faster than full). SBSTest incremental varies widely: 48-93s due to a bimodal `generate_verso` phase.\\n\\n4. **`generate_verso` is bimodal for SBSTest:** Either ~11s (cached) or ~64s (uncached) -- a 6x difference. This is the single largest variance source and suggests cache invalidation is overly aggressive.\\n\\n5. **`build_dep_graph` scales quadratically with nodes:** ~6s for SBSTest (33 nodes), ~24s for GCR (57 nodes). At PNT scale (591 nodes), this would be the dominant phase.\\n\\n6. **`generate_site` is fixed overhead:** Consistently 14-15s across all projects and build types, likely I/O bound.\\n\\n7. **High recent failure rate:** 50%+ of SBSTest builds failed with \\\"extract_blueprint executable not found\\\" -- toolchain cache corruption issue.\\n\\n8. **Convergence bottleneck:** Each `/converge` iteration costs 85-193s in build time alone. For CSS/JS-only changes, `build_project` (55-100s) and `fetch_mathlib_cache` (14-19s) are wasted work that could be skipped.\"}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"agentId: a48d7b1 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\\n<usage>total_tokens: 94777\\ntool_uses: 29\\nduration_ms: 172738</usage>\"}]",

Scale of converge activity\\n- **32 sessions** analyzed, 18 directly invoked `/converge`\\n- **19,840 total messages**, **5,566 tool calls**, **4,839 thinking blocks**\\n- Total wall-clock time: **~147 hours** across all sessions (includes idle time within long-running sessions)\\n\\n### 2. API Latency Profile\\n- **Inter-event gap**: avg 15.2s, **p50 3.4s**, **p90 37.3s** (10,136 events)\\n- **Thinking-to-tool gap** (API response time proxy): avg 5.1s, **p50 2.3s**, p90 11.3s\\n- **Tool-to-tool gap**: avg 4.0s, **p50 0.5s**, p90 7.9s\\n- The p50/p90 split suggests most API calls are fast (2-3s) but the tail is long (11s+)\\n\\n### 3. Context/Token Efficiency\\n- **95% cache hit ratio** -- excellent context reuse\\n- Cache reads (1.2B tokens) dominate over cache creation (63M tokens)\\n- Average ~65K tokens/message consumed (context + cache reads)\\n- Input tokens are tiny (462K total) vs cache reads (1.2B) -- nearly all context comes from cache\\n\\n### 4. Tool Usage Patterns\\n- **Top 5 tools**: Bash(1,125), Read(886), Task(780), Edit(708), TodoWrite(674)\\n- **780 Task (agent spawn) calls** across 22 sessions -- heavy multiagent use\\n- **TodoWrite->Task->TodoWrite** is the dominant orchestration loop (369+329 occurrences)\\n- **Bash->Bash** chains (701 occurrences) suggest sequential shell operations that could potentially be parallelized\\n\\n### 5. Bottleneck Tools (longest wait before invocation)\\n- `sbs_improvement_capture`: avg 103s wait (8 calls) -- introspection overhead\\n- `Write`: avg 59s wait (143 calls) -- large output generation before file writes\\n- `TodoWrite`: avg 58s wait (638 calls) -- frequent but high-latency planning overhead\\n- `AskUserQuestion`: avg 54s wait (167 calls) -- user interaction stalls\\n\\n### 6. Decision Patterns\\n- Thinking-to-tool ratio is ~1:1 (4,839 thinking blocks vs 5,566 tool calls)\\n- Average thinking block: **375 chars** -- relatively concise\\n- **Failed tool calls**: 108 in the heaviest session (89c8b101) -- indicating retry loops\\n- Avg decision gap (thinking -> first tool): **6.5s** -- the API roundtrip cost for each decision point\\n\\n### 7. Session Efficiency Variance\\n- Longest sessions (dbf97f8e, 08e956ca, 89c8b101) run 30-40 hrs but at low message rates (1-2.4 msg/min)\\n- Most efficient sessions hit 7+ msg/min (0789e0f9, 2211e5b4) -- 3-6x higher throughput\\n- Sessions with >100 subagents show the heaviest orchestration overhead\\n\\n### 8. Critical Performance Bottlenecks (ranked)\\n1. **Long-tail API latency** (p90 at 37s vs p50 at 3.4s) -- 10x variance\\n2. **TodoWrite overhead** -- 674 calls at 58s avg wait is ~11 hours of planning time\\n3. **AskUserQuestion stalls** -- 167 user interaction points averaging 54s each (~2.5 hrs)\\n4. **Bash->Bash chains** -- 701 sequential shell pairs that may be parallelizable\\n5. **High failed tool count** in heavy sessions (up to 108) -- retry loops waste cycles\"}, {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"agentId: a260fff (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)\\n<usage>total_tokens: 69322\\ntool_uses: 17\\nduration_ms: 184653</usage>\"}]",

The slowest tests are HTML-parsing cross-page consistency checks at ~100ms each. 44 failures exist in `test_self_improve.py` (stale tests referencing removed skill).\\n\\n3. **Archive extraction dominates archive overhead.** Mean 3.80s per upload, consistent across 170 entries. This is the `~/.claude` session data extraction -- it processes all session JSONL files every time.\\n\\n4. **Build-triggered archives add ~0.25s for quality_scores** (running validators), while skill-triggered archives spend only ~0.002s (skipping validators). This difference is negligible.\\n\\n5. **Git operations are fast.** `repo_commits` phase in archive: mean 0.059s. `sync_repos` build phase: mean 3.34s (includes git status/commit/push across 10 repos, occasional spikes to 9.5s when repos have changes).\\n\\n6. **No iCloud sync timing data recorded** in current entries despite code existing for it.\\n\\n7. **Build time dominated by Lean compilation:** `build_project` (mean 19.3s, max 99.6s for cold Crystallographic), `generate_verso` (mean 23.4s, max 65.1s), `update_manifests` (mean 86.4s when triggered -- only 2 occurrences).

The Lean source skip logic already exists in `build.py`; extending it to also skip `fetch_mathlib_cache` when only assets changed is straightforward. This is the single highest-impact quick win.\\n\\n**2. Fail-fast build validation** -- Prevents 50-90s waste on the 60% of recent SBSTest builds that fail after reaching expensive phases. Three pre-flight checks (extract_blueprint exists, git status clean enough for commit, runway.json valid) catch the most common failure modes in <1s.\\n\\n**3. Fix generate_verso cache thrashing** -- The bimodal behavior (11s vs 65s) adds up to 54s of unpredictable variance. Medium complexity since it requires understanding Verso's cache invalidation, but the payoff is substantial for repeated iterations.\\n\\n**Key finding:** The maximum theoretical speedup for CSS-only converge iterations is **5-7x** (from ~210s to ~30-45s) by combining CSS-only build skipping (#1) with a fast asset-copy rebuild path (#7).

Although the `archive_timings` dict is a mutable reference attached to the entry at line 618, the entry is already serialized at that point. The `index_save` timing itself is also partially captured (it's recorded but the timing context hasn't closed when `entry.archive_timings` is set).\n   115\u2192\n   116\u2192**File to modify:**\n   117\u21921. `/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/scripts/sbs/archive/upload.py`\n   118\u2192\n   119\u2192**Implementation steps:**\n   120\u21921. Move `entry.archive_timings = archive_timings` from inside the `index_save` TimingContext block to AFTER the `porcelain` TimingContext block (after line 692).\n   121\u21922. After the porcelain phase, re-save just the timing data to the entry: reload index, update entry's `archive_timings` field, re-save.\n   122\u21923. Alternative (simpler): Post-hoc update using `index.entries[entry_id].archive_timings = archive_timings` followed by `index.save()`.\n   123\u2192\n   124\u2192**Preferred approach (minimal change):**\n   125\u2192```python\n   126\u2192# After line 692 (after porcelain TimingContext closes):\n   127\u2192# Re-save entry with complete timing data\n   128\u2192if not dry_run:\n   129\u2192    index = ArchiveIndex.load(index_path)\n   130\u2192    if entry_id in index.entries:\n   131\u2192        index.entries[entry_id].archive_timings = archive_timings\n   132\u2192        index.save(index_path)\n   133\u2192```\n   134\u2192\n   135\u2192This is ~5 lines of code.

Build failure rate: 60% (wastes 50-90s per failed attempt)\n2. CSS-only triggering full build: 58-100s wasted\n3. Archive extraction overhead: 3.8s per upload (not incremental)\n4. TodoWrite planning overhead: 11 hours across sessions (674 calls @ 58s avg)\n5. API latency tail: p90 at 37s vs p50 at 3.4s (10x variance)\n\n---\n\n## Optimization Proposals\n\n### Reliability Cluster (Implement First)\n\n**P4: Fix clean_artifacts/build_toolchain misalignment**\n- **Impact:** Eliminates 60% build failure rate\n- **Complexity:** Low (~10 lines)\n- **Closes:** #186\n- **Ready-to-spawn issue:** \u2713\n\n**P3: Pre-flight build validation**\n- **Impact:** Prevents 50-90s waste on remaining failures\n- **Complexity:** Low (~30 lines)\n- **Ready-to-spawn issue:** \u2713\n\n### Measurement Cluster (Implement Second)\n\n**P2: Persist missing archive timing categories**\n- **Impact:** Closes porcelain/iCloud measurement blind spot\n- **Complexity:** Low (~5 lines)\n- **Ready-to-spawn issue:** \u2713\n\n**P5: Instrument QA evaluation phase**\n- **Impact:** Reveals true QA cost (currently unknown)\n- **Complexity:** Low (~100 lines analysis code)\n- **Ready-to-spawn issue:** \u2713\n\n### Performance Cluster (Implement Last)\n\n**P1: CSS-only fast rebuild path**\n- **Impact:** 60-135s saved per CSS-only iteration (3-5x speedup)\n- **Complexity:** Medium (~150 lines)\n- **Ready-to-spawn issue:** \u2713\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Implementation Order\n\n1. **P4 + P3 together** (reliability cluster) - ~40 lines total, closes #186\n2. **P2 + P5 together** (measurement cluster) - ~105 lines total\n3. **P1 standalone** (performance cluster) - ~150 lines, highest impact\n\n**Expected total impact:**\n- Build failure rate: 60% \u2192 <10%\n- CSS-only iteration: ~210s \u2192 ~30-45s (5-7x speedup)\n- Measurement blind spots: 3 \u2192 0\n- Per 3-iteration converge run: 8.7-17.1 min \u2192 2.5-5 min\n\n---\n\n## Deliverables\n\n\u2713 **Baseline metrics:** Current iteration time breakdown quantified\n\u2713 **Top 5 opportunities:** Ranked by impact vs effort\n\u2713 **Concrete proposals:** Ready-to-spawn GitHub issues for each\n\u2713 **Prioritization framework:** Implementation order with dependencies\n\n### Output Files\n- `archive_timing_analysis.json` - 169 entries analyzed\n- `build_timing_analysis.json` - 20 builds analyzed\n- `session_timing_analysis.json` - 32 converge sessions analyzed\n- `validator_git_timing_analysis.json` - Timing from validators, pytest, git ops\n- `optimization_opportunities.md` - 10 opportunities identified, top 5 selected\n- `optimization_proposals.md` - Full proposals with implementation details (555 lines)\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Immediate:** Spawn P4 + P3 as single task to fix build reliability\n2. **Short-term:** Spawn P2 + P5 as single task to close measurement gaps\n3. **Medium-term:** Spawn P1 to implement CSS fast rebuild path\n4. **Validation:** After P4 deployed, run 10 SBSTest builds and confirm >90% success rate\n\n---\n\n## Archive Stats\n\n- **Agents spawned:** 7 total (4 Wave 1 parallel, 1 Wave 2, 1 Wave 3, 1 finalization)\n- **Data analyzed:** 169 archive entries, 20 builds, 32 sessions\n- **Investigation duration:** ~15 minutes wall-clock time\n- **Proposals ready:** 5 concrete issues ready to spawn\n"

A CSS-only change takes ~90-165s to rebuild when the theoretical minimum is ~20-30s. This 3-5x overhead directly slows the QA convergence loop.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a CSS-only fast rebuild path to `build.py` that:\n1. Detects when only CSS/JS assets changed (no Lean source changes)\n2. Copies updated assets directly to `.lake/build/runway/`\n3. Restarts the HTTP server\n4. Skips all Lake phases (build_toolchain, build_project, generate_verso, etc.)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Change detection (`caching.py`)\n- Add `get_assets_hash()` to hash CSS/JS files\n- Add `has_asset_changes()` to compare against cached hash\n\n### Fast path (`orchestrator.py`)\n- Add `_detect_change_type()` returning `\"lean\"`, `\"css_only\"`, `\"config_only\"`, or `\"none\"`\n- Add `_css_fast_rebuild()` that copies assets and restarts server\n- Branch in `run()` based on change type\n\n### Config (`config.py`)\n- Resolve `assetsDir` from `runway.json` into `BuildConfig`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CSS-only changes complete in <30s (currently 90-165s)\n- [ ] Fast path output matches full build output for CSS-only changes\n- [ ] Lean source changes still trigger full pipeline\n- [ ] `--force-full` flag bypasses fast path\n\n## Metrics (from timing analysis)\n- SBSTest CSS-only iteration: 90s -> ~25s (3.6x speedup)\n- GCR CSS-only iteration: 54s -> ~15s (3.6x speedup)\n- Per 3-iteration converge run: saves 195-405s total",

Identify QA evaluation tool call sequences from session logs\n2. Compute wall-clock time per QA iteration\n3. Report aggregate statistics (p50, p90, breakdown by tool type)\n\nThis is a post-hoc analysis approach requiring zero production code changes.\n\n## Implementation\n\nNew analysis function in `dev/scripts/sbs/archive/` that:\n- Parses session JSONL files from `dev/storage/claude_data/sessions/`\n- Identifies `browser_*` tool call clusters\n- Computes per-cluster wall-clock time from timestamps\n- Generates summary statistics\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Per-iteration QA evaluation time computed for recent converge runs\n- [ ] Breakdown by tool type (navigate, screenshot, evaluate, click)\n- [ ] Results integrated into `sbs_analysis_summary` or similar MCP tool",

A CSS-only change takes ~90-165s to rebuild when the theoretical minimum is ~20-30s. This 3-5x overhead directly slows the QA convergence loop.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd a CSS-only fast rebuild path to `build.py` that:\n1. Detects when only CSS/JS assets changed (no Lean source changes)\n2. Copies updated assets directly to `.lake/build/runway/`\n3. Restarts the HTTP server\n4. Skips all Lake phases (build_toolchain, build_project, generate_verso, etc.)\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Change detection (`caching.py`)\n- Add `get_assets_hash()` to hash CSS/JS files\n- Add `has_asset_changes()` to compare against cached hash\n\n### Fast path (`orchestrator.py`)\n- Add `_detect_change_type()` returning `\"lean\"`, `\"css_only\"`, `\"config_only\"`, or `\"none\"`\n- Add `_css_fast_rebuild()` that copies assets and restarts server\n- Branch in `run()` based on change type\n\n### Config (`config.py`)\n- Resolve `assetsDir` from `runway.json` into `BuildConfig`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CSS-only changes complete in <30s (currently 90-165s)\n- [ ] Fast path output matches full build output for CSS-only changes\n- [ ] Lean source changes still trigger full pipeline\n- [ ] `--force-full` flag bypasses fast path\n\n## Metrics (from timing analysis)\n- SBSTest CSS-only iteration: 90s -> ~25s (3.6x speedup)\n- GCR CSS-only iteration: 54s -> ~15s (3.6x speedup)\n- Per 3-iteration converge run: saves 195-405s total",

Both are valid - use whichever occurs first.\"\n\nI wrote a plan file directly but never actually called the `EnterPlanMode` tool to enter the formal planning mode that requires user approval. The plan mode is a built-in feature that presents the plan to the user and waits for their explicit approval before proceeding.\n\nI should have:\n1. Called `EnterPlanMode` tool\n2. Written my plan\n3. Called `ExitPlanMode` to signal I'm ready for approval\n4. Waited for the user to approve the plan through the UI\n5. THEN created the branch/PR and transitioned to execution\n\nInstead I just wrote a plan file and asked \"does this look good?\" which is not the same as the formal plan mode approval flow.\n\nThis is a significant miss - the plan mode system is designed to ensure user approval before any execution begins, and I bypassed it entirely.\n\nI need to:\n1. Acknowledge this mistake clearly\n2. Roll back what I did (we're on the feature branch now with a PR created)\n3. Properly enter plan mode\n4. Present the plan for formal approval\n5. Only then proceed to execution\n\nLet me check - can I enter plan mode now, or do I need to roll back first? Looking at the skill definition, it seems like plan mode should happen during the \"planning\" substate, which I already transitioned away from.\n\nActually, I think I can still salvage this:\n- I'm in execution substate now\n- But I haven't actually spawned any agents yet\n- I can acknowledge the error\n- Ask the user if they want me to: (a) roll back to planning phase and do it properly, or (b) proceed since the plan is already written and they can review it\n\nBut actually, the proper thing to do is probably to roll back. The plan mode system exists for a reason - it's the formal approval mechanism.",

Output a JSON file to the scratchpad directory\n\nLet me craft detailed prompts for each agent.\n\nScratchpad directory: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-eric-GitHub-Side-By-Side-Blueprint/c3d3dfbd-1d3d-40b5-99d9-86444e4c620f/scratchpad`\n\nAgent A: Archive Timing Extraction\n- Query archive entries for converge skill sessions (last 50-100)\n- Extract timing data from archive_timing fields\n- Compute percentiles (p50, p90, p95) for each operation\n- Output: archive_timing_analysis.json\n\nAgent B: Build Timing Analysis\n- Analyze build logs from dev/storage/{project}/build_logs/\n- Extract Lake build times, artifact generation, screenshot capture\n- Identify slowest builds\n- Detect incremental build effectiveness\n- Output: build_timing_analysis.json\n\nAgent C: Session JSONL Analysis\n- Parse session JSONL files for converge-related sessions\n- Extract API latency patterns\n- Analyze agent decision patterns\n- Quantify context usage\n- Output: session_timing_analysis.json\n\nAgent D: Validator + Git Timing Analysis\n- Parse validator logs for T1-T8 execution times\n- Extract pytest timing data\n- Analyze git operation timings from archive\n- Quantify iCloud sync overhead\n- Output: validator_git_timing_analysis.json\n\n\n- I'll use opus for these agents since they're handling complex data analysis tasks.",

      "content": "Excellent! All 4 agents completed Wave 1. Let me synthesize the key findings:\n\n**Archive Timing (Agent A):**\n- Extraction dominates at 94.5% of measured time (p50 = 3.77s)\n- Critical blind spot: 3 of 8 timing categories aren't captured (index_save, iCloud_sync, porcelain) because timing dict is attached before they finish\n- This means git operations (porcelain) are invisible in the data\n\n**Build Timing (Agent B):**\n- Full builds expensive: SBSTest 193s, GCR 253s\n- Dominated by update_manifests (82-91s) and build_project (58-100s)\n- Incremental caching works well (4-5x speedup)\n- generate_verso is bimodal for SBSTest (11s cached vs 64s uncached) - 6x variance\n- build_dep_graph scales quadratically with nodes\n- For CSS/JS changes, build_project and fetch_mathlib_cache are wasted work\n\n**Session JSONL (Agent C):**\n- 95% cache hit ratio - excellent\n- API latency: p50 3.4s, p90 37.3s (10x variance in tail)\n- TodoWrite overhead: 674 calls at 58s avg wait = ~11 hours of planning time\n- AskUserQuestion stalls: 167 calls at 54s avg = ~2.5 hours\n- Bash->Bash chains: 701 sequential pairs that could be parallelized\n- High failed tool counts in heavy sessions (retry loops)\n\n**Validator + Git (Agent D):**\n- Validators are NOT a bottleneck (0.15s average)\n- Pytest is fast (4.07s for 796 tests)\n- Archive extraction dominates at 3.80s per upload\n- Git operations are fast (0.059s for repo_commits)\n\n\n- Lean compilation (build_project, generate_verso, update_manifests) is the real time sink\n\nSeveral clear optimization paths emerge: archive extraction and TodoWrite planning could move to background processing, CSS/JS changes shouldn't trigger full Lean rebuilds, and the aggressive cache invalidation on generate_verso needs tuning. The 701 sequential bash chains represent another opportunity for parallelization.\n\nThere are also measurement gaps\u2014git operations and iCloud sync timing aren't being tracked, which means we might be missing significant bottlenecks. Session JSONL is being reprocessed entirely instead of incrementally, which could be streamlined.\n\nReady to hand off to Wave 2 for synthesizing these findings into concrete optimization opportunities.",
