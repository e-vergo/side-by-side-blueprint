All other phases keep strict single-agent policy.\n\n### File 1: /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/CLAUDE.md\n\n1. **Orchestration Model table** \u2014 change `Spawns agents (one at a time)` to `Spawns agents (one at a time; up to 4 during /task execution)`\n\n2. **Single Agent Architecture section** \u2014 rewrite to be phase-aware:\n   - Default: one `sbs-developer` at a time\n   - During `/task` execution phase: up to 4 concurrent `sbs-developer` agents allowed\n   - Read-only exploration agents remain unlimited alongside\n\n3. **Spawning Protocol** \u2014 add a note that during `/task` execution, up to 4 agents may be spawned in a single message per the approved plan\n\n### File 2: /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/.claude/skills/task/SKILL.md\n\n1. **Phase 3: Execution (~line 195-210)** \u2014 replace the doc-only parallel exception with:\n   - Up to 4 `sbs-developer` agents may run concurrently\n   - The plan determines which waves are parallel vs sequential\n   - Spawn parallel wave agents in a SINGLE message with multiple Task tool calls\n   - Validators run after all parallel agents in a wave complete\n   - Keep the rest of Phase 3 content intact\n\n2. **Task Agent Model section (~line 498)** \u2014 update the \"Single-agent constraint\" bullet to note the execution-phase exception (up to 4)\n\n### File 3: /Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/.claude/agents/sbs-developer.md\n\n1. **Agent Parallelism section (~line 83-89)** \u2014 update to reflect that up to 4 instances can run concurrently during `/task` execution phase. Collision avoidance is the plan's responsibility.\n\n### Commit\n\nAfter all edits, stage the 3 files and commit with message:\n```\nfeat: allow up to 4 parallel agents during /task execution phase\n\nRelaxes the single-agent architectural invariant specifically for the\nexecution phase of /task.

The task was a config-only documentation change to 3 files: CLAUDE.md, .claude/skills/task/SKILL.md, and .claude/agents/sbs-developer.md.\n\n**What happened:**\n1. Issue #101 was loaded -- requesting relaxation of the single-agent constraint during /task execution phase\n2. Alignment was brief: user gave clear, minimal direction -- \"just max concurrency of 4\" with trust in plan quality for collision avoidance\n3. Plan was simple: update 6 passages across 3 files\n4. Execution was single-wave: one sbs-developer agent edited all 3 files and committed\n5. Gates passed: 630 evergreen tests, 0 failures, grep confirmed no stale language\n6. PR #103 merged, issue #101 closed\n7. Handoff to /update-and-archive\n\n**Key observations for the 5 dimensions:**\n\n1. **User Orchestration**: Extremely efficient. User gave a single directive that resolved all 4 alignment questions at once. No back-and-forth needed. The user trusts the planning phase to handle collision avoidance rather than adding explicit guardrails.\n\n2. **Claude Alignment**: Good. The initial alignment questions were well-structured (scope, granularity, safety, validation timing). The user's single response addressed all of them. No misunderstandings.\n\n3. **System Design**: Smooth execution. The skill machinery (archive state, skill transitions, PR creation, merge) all worked without friction. The MCP tools handled the full lifecycle cleanly.\n\n4. **Plan Execution**: Plan followed exactly. Config-only scope was accurate. Single agent was sufficient. No mid-flight adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Meta-Observations**: This task is self-referential -- it modifies the orchestration rules that govern how tasks execute. The change itself (parallel agents during execution) will affect future task sessions. Worth noting that the very next session using `/task` will operate under the updated rules.\n\n### Format\n\nUse this structure:\n```markdown\n# Session Retrospective: 1770161268\n\n**Task:** #101 - Allow parallel agents during task execution phase only\n**PR:** #103\n**Duration:** Single session, ~5 minutes wall clock\n**Scope:** Config-only (3 markdown files)\n\n## 1.
