The intent of sharing this with you is so you can understand what we have been working towards this entire time (in my head). At the start at didn\u2019t see the full architecture yet but building this helps clarify things. This has further feature inclusions, but they are \u2018killer features\u2019 that will really wow people. And given what I have seen you do I think you can pull this off.  I will write the post, but I want you to see this so you you understand the context, what you are building will be shared with the creator of lean, Terrence Tao, and other high profile people. I will review and monitor everything, of course.

Making a parent repository private does NOT change the visibility of its submodules\n4. Each submodule needs to be made private separately if that's desired\n\nThe submodules like:\n- forks/verso\n- forks/subverso\n- forks/LeanArchitect\n- toolchain/Dress\n- toolchain/Runway\n- etc.\n\nare all separate repositories with their own visibility settings.\n\nThis is a factual question about how GitHub and git submodules work, so I should give a direct, clear answer.",
