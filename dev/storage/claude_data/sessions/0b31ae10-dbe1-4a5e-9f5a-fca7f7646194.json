This phase is user-led -- let them shape the issue.\n\n1. **Parse input** for title, body, type flags, area flags, and initial keywords\n2. **Acknowledge** what you understood from the input\n3. **Probe gently** for what's missing or ambiguous:\n   - If type is unclear, ask with options (see Parsing Rules)\n   - If scope/context is thin, ask clarifying questions\n   - If the user gave a rich description, reflect it back to confirm understanding\n4. **Let the user guide.** They may want to refine scope, add context, split into multiple issues, or change direction entirely. Follow their lead.\n5. **Do NOT draft the issue until alignment is achieved** -- meaning you and the user agree on what the issue should say.\n\n**Alignment is achieved when:** You can articulate the issue clearly and the user confirms (explicitly or implicitly) that you've understood correctly. For simple, unambiguous inputs (e.g., `/log --bug sidebar broken`) alignment may be a single exchange. For vague or complex inputs, it may take several turns.\n\n### Phase 2: Draft & Review\n\nOnce aligned, draft the complete issue and present it for approval.\n\n6. **Infer labels** (type, area, conditional) from the aligned understanding\n7. **Draft the full issue** and present it:\n\n```\nDraft issue:\n\n  Title: Graph nodes overlap when cycle present\n  Labels: origin:agent, bug:visual, area:sbs:graph, impact:visual\n  Body:\n    When the dependency graph contains a cycle, nodes overlap\n    and edges cross through unrelated nodes.

After creating an issue:\n- Report it and move on\n- Do not suggest immediate fixes or offer to resolve unless the user asks\n- Do not tie the issue to a `/task` invocation unless the user initiates that connection\n- The issue exists to be tracked, not to be closed in the same breath it was opened"

I need to clarify whether they want me to log this as a GitHub issue or actually update the SKILL.md file, and I should check their stated preference for confirmation through questioning before proceeding.
