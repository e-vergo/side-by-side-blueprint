In the taxonomy session, 13/15 questions used pre-offered options; 2 used \"Other\" when pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance. In the config session, a single directive sufficed for the entire task. The user consistently favors the most comprehensive/ambitious option and communicates at high velocity.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Implication:** Alignment questions are well-calibrated. The \"Other\" escape hatch works as designed. Verbosity in confirmations is friction, not thoroughness.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192### Pattern 2: Simplicity Signals Are Strong Directives\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192In 2 of 5 sessions (40%), the user redirected Claude away from over-engineering. The pattern: user references an existing implementation -> Claude proposes alternatives -> user says \"match the existing one.\" This is a systematic tendency, not a one-off.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Implication:** Claude's design exploration instinct conflicts with user's \"match proven patterns\" preference. This needs explicit counterprogramming in agent guidance.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192### Pattern 3: Agent Spawn Decision Needs Mode Awareness\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192Session 1770160373 showed the orchestrator offering agent spawn when the user was in \"doing mode\" (editing directly in VSCode). The existing rule (3+ Bash calls) wasn't sufficient -- the user's mode was signaled by direct file edits, not bash commands.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Implication:** Doing mode detection needs richer signals beyond bash call count.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192### Pattern 4: System Infrastructure Works but Doesn't Observe Itself\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192All 5 sessions had clean builds, clean gate checks, successful PR workflows, and atomic skill handoffs. The infrastructure is reliable. However, the observation layer (tags, quality scores) is broken -- tags don't discriminate and quality scores cover only 3% of entries. The system works but can't measure how well it works.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192---\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192**L1 observations:** User communication is efficient, alignment questions work well, finalization can be faster. Doing mode detection failed once.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries), 81 issue-driven vs 74 freeform tasks. No interruptions in 84/85 sessions.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Synthesis:** The user-facing interaction model is mature. The remaining friction is at the margins: verbose finalization confirmations and a single doing mode detection failure. Two issues logged (#113 doing mode, #116 verbose finalization).\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval rate, zero backward transitions. One session (taxonomy) executed 13 commits across 3 waves with zero regressions. Execution quality is high when aligned.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192**MCP findings:** 85% task completion rate. Finalization is the most common failure substate. 2 planning phases skipped.\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192**Synthesis:** Execution quality is strong but completion rate has room to improve. The 15% incompletion likely stems from context compaction in long sessions disrupting the finalization ceremony. One investigation issue logged (#114).\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192**L1 observations:** Over-engineering in 2/5 sessions when user had clear pattern reference. 100% plan approval on first presentation.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192**MCP findings:** 29/29 plans reached execution (100% approval). Zero backward transitions.\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192**Synthesis:** Alignment succeeds structurally (plans always approved) but Claude's tendency to explore design space creates friction when the user wants simplicity ma",

Two remaining issues (#111, #114) are investigations requiring deeper work.\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192---\n    34\u2192\n    35\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192### Pattern 1: Observation Layer Remains the Weakest Link\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192Despite closing #110, the tag system still produces zero discriminatory signal. All 83 tags have signal_score 0.0. The per-session scoping fix prevented cross-session leakage but didn't address the fundamental problem: rules fire uniformly across all sessions. Quality score coverage remains at 3.2%. The system works reliably but cannot measure how well it works. This was the top finding in L2 cycle 1 and remains the top finding in cycle 2.\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Trend:** Persistent. Two cycles, same core issue. #121 reopens this with a focus on rule discrimination rather than scope leakage.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192### Pattern 2: Parallel Agent Coordination Maturing but Has Blind Spots\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192The MVP session (8 agents, 4 waves) and triage session (6 agents, 3 waves) both executed cleanly with zero file collisions and no backward transitions. Parallelism mechanics are solid. However, exploration-phase parallelism has a quality gap: multiple agents independently confirm the same fact instead of dividing investigation dimensions.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Not visible in cycle 1 because previous sessions used fewer exploration agents.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192### Pattern 3: Tool Trust Requires Qualification\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192The MCP module caching issue (retrospective 1770174216) introduced a new category of system friction: tool output diverging from ground truth due to stale process state. This is distinct from previous tool issues (missing capabilities, wrong thresholds) -- it's a reliability hazard where the tool appears to work but returns stale data.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192**Trend:** New finding. Specific to sessions where Python source is edited and then validated via MCP.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192### Pattern 4: Meta-Recursion Accelerates Improvement\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192The triage session (#120) implemented fixes from the previous self-improve cycle (#112, #113, #115, #116) and immediately validated two of them within the same session. #116 (compressed finalization) was used successfully at the session's end. This demonstrates a healthy feedback loop where self-improve findings translate to actionable fixes that are exercised in subsequent sessions.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192---\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**L1 observations:** User continues to be decisive and efficient. Compressed finalization (#116) validated. Triage alignment: 0.2 questions per issue. Visual review during planning surfaces concrete requirements.\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment (<=2 entries). 85 issue-driven, 78 freeform tasks. 1 interruption in 90 sessions.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Synthesis:** User interaction is stable and efficient. The main improvement opportunity is structural: documenting triage wave patterns (#127) so future sessions benefit from the efficient structure observed in 1770174216. No regressions from cycle 1.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192**L1 observations:** Exploration redundancy (4 agents on same question).

Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:\n    43\u2192- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    44\u2192- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192The crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:\n    53\u2192- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%\n    54\u2192- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)\n    55\u2192- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)\n    56\u2192- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192The exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192The MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:\n    63\u21921. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning\n    64\u21922. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192This is distinct from the \"simplicity matching\" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192Three cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero impro",

These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192---\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192Cycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192This is the same \"closure != resolution\" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192Two `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3. The tool is being used as intended.\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pattern 3: Execution Quality Continues Upward Trend\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192| Metric | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 |\n    61\u2192|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n    62\u2192| Task completion | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% |\n    63\u2192| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n    64\u2192| Gate failures | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 |\n    65\u2192| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n    66\u2192| Interruption rate | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 |\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192The crush session (#7 issues, 4 agents, 0 retries) and QA skill session (#144, 2 agents, 0 retries) both show clean execution. The process is maturing.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192Quality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags).

Tags like `signal:retry-loop` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate. This has been true for multiple cycles but this is the first time a retrospective explicitly flagged it as misleading (\"over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns\").\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The tag system currently serves as a session classifier, not an entry classifier. This distinction hasn't been articulated before.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Crush Mode is a Mature, Reliable Pattern\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192Two consecutive sessions (#155 feature task, then crush) both executed cleanly with no retries, no collisions, and 100% plan approval. The crush specifically: 8 issues, 5 waves, 8 agents, 0 corrections. The triage-table presentation format enables fast approval. Crush mode has crossed from \"experimental\" to \"standard operating procedure.\"\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 3: Guidance Verification Debt is Compounding\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192| Cycle | Guidance additions | Verified |\n    57\u2192|-------|-------------------|----------|\n    58\u2192| 2 | ~5 | 2 |\n    59\u2192| 3 | ~5 | 0 |\n    60\u2192| 4 | 3 | 0 |\n    61\u2192| 5 (crush closures) | 8 | 0 |\n    62\u2192| **Total** | **~21** | **2** |\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192This is the most concerning cross-session pattern. 90%+ of guidance additions remain unverified. The self-improve cycle creates recommendations, which get closed via code/doc changes, but there's no feedback loop confirming behavioral change. Issue #164 addresses this.\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192### Pattern 4: Execution Metrics Continue Stable\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192| Metric | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Cycle 5 |\n    69\u2192|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n    70\u2192| Task completion | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% |\n    71\u2192| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n    72\u2192| Gate failures | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 |\n    73\u2192| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n    74\u2192| Interruption rate | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 |\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192All operational metrics are stable or improving slightly.

This is genuine meta-cognitive maturation, not just iteration.\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192### Finding Depth vs. Finding Count\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192| Cycle | Findings Logged | Nature |\n    29\u2192|-------|----------------|--------|\n    30\u2192| 1 | 7 | Broad surface sweep |\n    31\u2192| 2 | 7 | Targeted refinements |\n    32\u2192| 3 | 8 | Deepest single-cycle output |\n    33\u2192| 4 | 3 | Fewer but deeper |\n    34\u2192| 5 | 5 | Meta-process + precision |\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192Total: 30 issues logged across 5 cycles. The count peaked at cycle 3 then declined, while depth increased. This is the classic pattern of a system transitioning from problem discovery to problem understanding. The system is not running out of things to find; it is finding fewer, harder things.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192### Closure vs. Verification: The Central Tension\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192| Cycle | Issues from previous cycle | Closed | Verified |\n    41\u2192|-------|---------------------------|--------|----------|\n    42\u2192| 2 | 7 from cycle 1 | 5 (71%) | 2 |\n    43\u2192| 3 | 7 from cycle 2 | 7 (100%) | ~0 (metric targets unchanged) |\n    44\u2192| 4 | 8 from cycle 3 | 6 (75%) | 0 |\n    45\u2192| 5 | 3+2 from cycle 4 | 5 (100%) | 0 |\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192The closure pipeline accelerated from 71% to 100%. The verification pipeline never started. This is the single most important structural finding across all 5 L2 documents: the system has optimized for closing issues while leaving verification as an afterthought. Cycle 3 was the first to name this explicitly (\"Issue closure != problem resolution\"). Cycle 4 formalized it. Cycle 5 logged a protocol for it (#164). But as of the final cycle, zero guidance additions from cycles 3-5 have been verified in practice.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192### Is the System Maturing or Plateauing?\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192Both. Execution metrics show steady improvement (task completion 85% to 87.8%). Finding quality shows genuine deepening. But the system's ability to verify its own improvements is stalled -- it has identified the verification gap in 3 consecutive cycles without closing it. The system is maturing in what it observes but plateauing in its ability to act on observations about itself.\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192---\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192## 2. Recurring Friction Inventory\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192Three problems appear in 3+ L2 summaries despite being \"addressed.\" Their persistence is diagnostic.\n    58\u2192\n    59\u2192### Auto-Tag Signal Uniformity\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192| Cycle | Status | Signal Score | Action Taken |\n    62\u2192|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|\n    63\u2192| 1 | Identified (#110) | 0.0 | Issue logged |\n    64\u2192| 2 | Fix attempted (#121) | 0.0 | Per-session scoping added; didn't help |\n    65\u2192| 3 | Architectural redirect (#138) | 0.0 | Deferred to DuckDB (#118) |\n    66\u2192| 4 | Acknowledged as structural | 0.0 | No new action |\n    67\u2192| 5 | Reclassified (#160) | 0.0 | Session-level vs entry-level distinction articulated |\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192**Appearances:** 5/5 cycles. Zero metric improvement.\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192**Diagnosis:** The tag system was designed with a flawed assumption: that session-level metadata (token counts, tool distributions, model versions) would produce entry-level discrimination. It cannot, by construction. Five cycles of attempted fixes produced zero signal improvement because the architecture is wrong, not the implementation. Cycle 3 recognized this and redirected ",
