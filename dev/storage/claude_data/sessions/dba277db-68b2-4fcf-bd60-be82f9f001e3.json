User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192**Effective patterns:**\n    14\u2192- The user provided a well-structured issue (#144) that clearly defined scope: browser tools + QA skill definition. This made alignment fast -- 3 questions sufficed for the entire task.\n    15\u2192- User caught two process failures in real-time and communicated corrections clearly: (1) \"you should have explored before asking me\" about Chrome MCP availability, and (2) the direct correction that exploration should come before questions, not after.\n    16\u2192- User's mid-session insight about extending existing Playwright infrastructure rather than adding a separate Chrome MCP was the right architectural call. It avoided adding a new dependency and kept the tool surface unified.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Areas for improvement:**\n    19\u2192- The user had to correct an assumption about Chrome DevTools MCP being installed. The user themselves initially thought they had it (\"yes, I think so\") but then exploration revealed it wasn't configured. This was a case where both user and agent had uncertain information -- the agent should have checked `.mcp.json` first rather than asking.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Observation for L2:** The user explicitly stated that exploration should happen BEFORE asking questions. This is a refinement of the oracle-first principle -- it extends to MCP configuration, installed tools, and any checkable state. The improvement was captured in-session via `sbs_improvement_capture`.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192**What went right:**\n    26\u2192- After the user's correction about exploration-before-questions, alignment shifted to a more productive pattern. The remaining questions were genuinely about requirements (scope of browser tools, persistent page vs ephemeral pattern) rather than discoverable facts.\n    27\u2192- The decision to extend sbs-lsp Playwright rather than add Chrome MCP was reached collaboratively: user thought they had Chrome MCP, exploration revealed they didn't, then the shared realization that existing Playwright in sbs-lsp was the right foundation.\n    28\u2192- Wave structure (2 parallel agents: browser tools in sbs-lsp-mcp, QA skill definition in main repo) was correctly identified as independent work with zero file overlap.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Assumption errors:**\n    31\u2192- Asked \"do you have Chrome MCP installed?\" when `.mcp.json` was a checkable file. This violated the oracle-first / exploration-first principle. The agent should have read the MCP configuration file before asking.\n    32\u2192- Initial framing assumed Chrome DevTools MCP was the right approach, which biased the alignment conversation. Starting with exploration of existing capabilities (Playwright in sbs-lsp) would have reached the correct architecture faster.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192## 3. System Design\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**New capability established:**\n    37\u2192- 5 general-purpose browser tools (`browser_navigate`, `browser_click`, `browser_screenshot`, `browser_evaluate`, `browser_get_elements`) with a persistent active page pattern. This is architecturally distinct from the Zulip tools which create ephemeral pages per call. The persistent pattern enables stateful browsing sessions needed for QA workflows.\n    38\u2192- The tools are general-purpose by design -- not QA-specific. They can be used by any skill or workflow that needs browser automation.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Active page lifecycle:**\n    41\u2192- `active_page` field on `AppContext` (nullable). Set by `browser_navigate`, consumed by all other browser tools. Cleaned up on server shutdown. This is the simplest possible state management for persistent browsing.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192**QA skill design:**\n    44\u2192- Three-phase workflow: setup (ensure server running, navigate) -> review (per-page systematic checks) -> report (structured findings). Uses compliance criteria from the existing test catalog as the checklist, not ad-hoc visual inspection.\n    45\u2192- No new MCP tools were needed for the skill itself -- it uses the 5 browser tools + existing `sbs_inspect_project` for context.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192**Plan adherence:** The approved plan was executed as written. Both waves completed successfully on first attempt.\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192**What was well-estimated:**\n    52\u2192- 2-agent parallel wave was correct: Agent 1 (browser tools in sbs-lsp-mcp: `browser_tools.py`, `sbs_models.py`, `server.py`) and Agent 2 (QA skill: `.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md`) had zero file overlap.\n    53\u2192- The scope of browser tools (5 tools) was right-sized: enough for QA workflows without overbuilding. Each tool has a clear,",

User Orchestration\n    11\u2192\n    12\u2192**Efficiency: High.** The user invoked `/task crush` with a well-defined scope (open issues). The alignment phase was a single triage proposal followed by a single confirmation -- no back-and-forth needed. The user approved the plan on first presentation, indicating the triage categorization (close-now vs defer) matched expectations.\n    13\u2192\n    14\u2192**Observation:** The crush format works well for housekeeping backlogs. The user's decision to defer 6 issues was immediate, suggesting clear internal prioritization. No doing-mode signals were present throughout.\n    15\u2192\n    16\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Accuracy: High.** The triage split (7 actionable / 6 deferred) was accepted without modification. Issue categorization was correct -- #138 (auto-tagger deferral) was correctly identified as closeable by decision rather than code, while #147 (zebra striping) and #141 (self-improve entry search) required actual implementation.\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192**Wave decomposition was sound:** Separating docs (Wave 1) from code (Wave 2) prevented file collisions and allowed parallel execution within each wave. Wave 0 (closing #138 directly) was correctly identified as requiring no agent.\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192**No corrections or redirections occurred during the session.**\n    23\u2192\n    24\u2192## 3. System Design\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192**Build pipeline:** All 689 evergreen tests passed with 0 failures across the session. No gate failures, no retries needed. The PR workflow (create -> merge) executed cleanly via `sbs_pr_create` and `sbs_pr_merge`.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Parallel agent execution:** 4 agents ran across 2 waves (2 per wave) without file collisions. The file-scope partitioning (SKILL.md vs sbs-developer.md in Wave 1; blueprint.css vs sbs_self_improve.py in Wave 2) was clean.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Observation:** The crush mode pattern (triage -> waves -> PR -> merge) is now well-established. The only manual step was the initial triage decision.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Adherence: Complete.** All 7 issues resolved as planned:\n    35\u2192- Wave 0: #138 closed directly (policy decision, no code)\n    36\u2192- Wave 1: #136, #139, #140 (SKILL.md updates), #137 (sbs-developer.md update) -- both agents completed successfully\n    37\u2192- Wave 2: #147 (CSS zebra striping added), #141 (self-improve entry search fixed) -- both agents completed successfully\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192**PR #151** created and merged via squash strategy. No merge conflicts.\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Timing:** The session was efficient -- exploration phase used 4 parallel read-only agents to gather context, then 3 execution waves ran without blocking.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192- **Crush mode maturity:** This is now a reliable pattern for batch issue resolution. The triage -> categorize -> wave-execute -> merge flow is predictable and efficient.\n    46\u2192- **Deferred issue quality:** The 6 deferred issues (#99, #142, #143, #146, #148, #149) represent genuinely larger work items that would not benefit from crush treatment. Good triage discipline.\n    47\u2192- **Documentation-first wave ordering:** Putting docs before code in wave ordering is a good default -- docs changes are lower risk and establish context for code changes.\n    48\u2192- **No friction points identified in this session.** The workflow executed as designed.\n    49\u2192\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware.

No recurrence in subsequent sessions. |\n    27\u2192| #124 (call-chain tracing) | Closed | Guidance added.

No feature removals in subsequent sessions to validate. |\n    29\u2192| #126 (question_stats datetime) | Closed | Fixed. Tool now returns 544 questions across 81 sessions. Fully functional. |\n    30\u2192| #127 (triage wave structure) | Closed | Guidance added and immediately validated in crush session (1770180967). |\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Closure rate:** 7/7 (100%, up from 71% in cycle 1).\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Key finding:** High closure rate does not guarantee metric improvement. #121 and #111 were closed but their target metrics (tag discrimination, quality coverage) show zero improvement. Issue closure tracked code changes; downstream metric verification was missing.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192---\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192### Pattern 1: Issue Closure != Problem Resolution\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192The most important meta-observation of this cycle. Both persistent findings (tags, quality scores) had issues closed in the crush session, but the underlying metrics didn't change. The crush session closed #121 with rule redesign and #111 with investigation findings, but:\n    43\u2192- Tags: Still ALL at signal_score 0.0 (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    44\u2192- Quality coverage: Still at 3.1% (3rd consecutive cycle)\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192**Root cause:** Issues were closed based on code changes expected to fix the problem. No verification step confirmed the metric actually improved post-closure. This is a systemic gap in the issue lifecycle.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192**Action taken:** For tags, deferred to DuckDB (#118, #138). For quality scores, proposed build pipeline integration (#143) instead of standalone tooling.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Pattern 2: Execution Quality Continues to Improve\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192The crush session (10 issues, 5 waves, 7 agents, 0 retries) is the cleanest execution observed. Combined with the #133/#134 session (2 issues, parallel agents, 0 retries), execution quality is trending strongly positive:\n    53\u2192- Task completion: 85% -> 85.7% -> 86.7%\n    54\u2192- Backward transitions: 0 (stable across all 3 cycles)\n    55\u2192- Gate failures: 0/26 (stable)\n    56\u2192- Plan approval: 31/31 (100%)\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192The exploration-then-plan pattern is now validated across multiple session types (single-issue, multi-issue crush, feature implementation).\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192### Pattern 3: Known Documentation Not Consulted\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192The MVP session (retrospective 1770178263) revealed a new failure mode: agents not consulting existing documentation before planning/executing. Two instances:\n    63\u21921. Known Limitations (Verso pages removed) -- in CLAUDE.md, not read before planning\n    64\u21922. ID Normalization rules -- in sbs-developer.md, not applied during test writing\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192This is distinct from the \"simplicity matching\" pattern identified in cycle 1. That was about design preference; this is about factual constraints that are documented but not consulted. Two new issues (#136, #137) address this.\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192### Pattern 4: Observation Layer Debt Is Structural, Not Incremental\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192Three cycles of incremental fixes to the observation layer (tags, quality scores) have produced zero impro",

This wasted a user interaction and biased alignment toward the wrong architecture (Chrome DevTools MCP vs extending existing Playwright in sbs-lsp).\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Retrospective 1770185443: \"Asked 'do you have Chrome MCP installed?' when `.mcp.json` was a checkable file.

This covers checkable runtime state.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nAdd explicit guidance to `sbs-developer.md` and the \"Oracle-First Approach\" section of `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n> Before asking the user about tool availability, installed packages, configuration state, or any checkable fact, explore first. Check `.mcp.json`, `package.json`, config files, environment state.

User explicitly corrected. 2 parallel agents, zero retries. |\n| 1770188134 | /task crush (7 issues: #136-141, #147) | Cleanest crush session yet. 4 agents across 2 waves, zero retries, zero corrections. Documentation-first wave ordering validated. |\n\n## Improvement Captures Reviewed\n\n| Entry ID | Category | Observation |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| 1770184492 | interaction | Exploration should precede user questions during alignment. Check config/state before asking. |\n| 1770187075 | tooling | sbs_serve_project returns {running: false} without error details. QA skill needed manual fallback. |\n\n---\n\n## Previous Cycle Follow-Up\n\n| Issue | Status | Outcome |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| #136 (pre-flight checklist) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to SKILL.md. No post-closure /task session to verify yet. |\n| #137 (consult docs before coding) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to sbs-developer.md. No post-closure session to verify. |\n| #138 (defer auto-tagger to DuckDB) | Closed (crush) | Policy decision. Tags still 0.0 signal score; DuckDB path acknowledged. |\n| #139 (quantitative success criteria) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added. No post-closure session to verify. |\n| #140 (taxonomy test reminder) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added. No post-closure session to verify. |\n| #141 (self-improve entry search fix) | Closed (crush) | Code fix applied. Tool now returns correct entries. |\n| #143 (quality validators in build.py) | Still open | Quality coverage still 3.1%. 4th cycle unchanged. |\n| #142 (e2e test for improvement_capture) | Still open | Tool actively used (2 captures between cycles), but no formal test. |\n\n**Closure rate for cycle 3 issues:** 6/8 closed (75%). 2 remaining (#142, #143) are implementation work, not guidance updates.\n\n**Key finding:** 6 of 8 issues from the previous cycle were guidance additions closed in a single crush session. These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Session Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification\n\nCycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.\n\nThis is the same \"closure != resolution\" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).\n\n### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working\n\nTwo `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3. The tool is being used as intended.\n\n### Pattern 3: Execution Quality Continues Upward Trend\n\n| Metric | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Task completion | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% |\n| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Gate failures | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 |\n| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n| Interruption rate | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 |\n\nThe crush session (#7 issues, 4 agents, 0 retries) and QA skill session (#144, 2 agents, 0 retries) both show clean execution. The process is maturing.\n\n### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved\n\nQuality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags). Until those are implemented, these metrics will remain static.\n\n---\n\n## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n\n### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n\n**L1 observations:** User continues efficient and decisive. Crush alignment: single triage proposal, single approval. QA session: 3 questions total. Two improvement captures demonstrate active engagement with the observation system.\n\n**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment. 2/103 interruptions (one correction keyword in QA notes). sbs_improvement_capture actively used.\n\n**Synthesis:** User interaction remains the strongest pillar. The explore-before-ask principle (#152) addresses the one identified friction point. No regression in communication effectiveness.\n\n### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n\n**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in both sessions reviewed. Crush mode is a mature pattern. 4-agent parallel waves executed without collision.\n\n**MCP findings:** Task completion 87.2% (up from 86.7%). Finalization remains most common failure substate. Self-improve dialogue phase is disproportionately long (1688.9s avg) but not critical.\n\n**Synthesis:** Execution quality is the best it's been. The dialogue phase length (noted but not logged) is a natural consequence of interactive refinement and may not need fixing. If it becomes a bottleneck, batching findings could help.\n\n### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n\n**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval across both sessions. No mid-execution redirections. Metric verification gap identified as persistent.\n\n**MCP findings:** 31/31 plans reached execution. 0 backward transitions. 2 skipped planning phases historically (not in recent sessions).\n\n**Synthesis:** Alignment is strong operationally but weak on verification. #154 (metric verification in finalization) addresses the systemic gap between \"code merged\" and \"problem solved.\"\n\n### Pillar 4: System Engineering\n\n**L1 observations:** sbs_serve_project error handling inadequate. sbs-lsp-mcp tool count grew to 67 (docs say 62). Build infrastructure reliable.\n\n**MCP findings:** 0 gate failures. Quality coverage 3.1% (#143 still open). Tags 0.0 signal (deferred to DuckDB). Overall health: \"healthy.\"\n\n**Synthesis:** Infrastructure reliability remains solid. Two tooling gaps addressed: #153 (serve tool errors) and the persistent #143 (quality score integration). The observation layer debt continues but is now architecturally redirected.\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Observations\n\n### Guidance Verification Debt\n\nThe project has accumulated ~14 unverified guidance additions across cycles 2-4. This is a new form of debt: we're writing process improvements into SKILL.md and agent files faster than we can verify they work. The next cycle should prioritize verification over new findings.\n\n### Cycle Efficiency Improving\n\nThis cycle completed with 4 findings discovered, 3 selected, 3 logged. Previous cycles: 7, 7, 8 findings respectively. Fewer findings per cycle suggests the system is stabilizing -- there are fewer novel problems to discover. The findings that remain are deeper (metric verification, tooling error messages) rather than surface-level.\n\n### Self-Improve Dialogue Phase\n\nAt 1688.9s average, this phase dominates the skill's runtime. This cycle deliberately kept dialogue minimal (single confirmation for all 3 findings) to test whether batched review is viable. If the user found this effective, future cycles should default to batched review.\n\n---\n\n## Findings Logged\n\n| # | Issue | Pillar | Impact |\n|---|-------|--------|--------|\n| #152 | Codify explore-before-ask for runtime/config state | User Effectiveness | High |\n| #153 | sbs_serve_project returns unhelpful errors | System Engineering | High |\n| #154 | Add metric verification to /task finalization | Alignment Patterns | High |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Next Cycle\n\n1. **Verify guidance additions.** 14 unverified guidance changes have accumulated. Check whether subsequent sessions demonstrate the prescribed behaviors (explore-before-ask, pre-flight checklist, documentation consultation, quantitative probing).\n2. **Track #143 and #153.** Both are implementation work. If #143 is implemented, quality coverage should jump measurably. If #153 is implemented, /qa should no longer need Bash server fallback.\n3. **Verify #154 in practice.** Does the metric verification step in /task finalization actually prevent premature issue closure? This is the highest-leverage process improvement from this cycle.\n4. **Observe improvement capture usage.** Two captures between cycles 3 and 4. Trend data will be meaningful after 2-3 more cycles.\n5. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Cycle 1: 7 issues. Cycle 2: 7 issues (100% closure). Cycle 3: 8 issues (75% closure so far). Cycle 4: 3 issues. Finding count decreasing, finding depth increasing. System stabilizing.\n"

Exploration-before-questions principle crystallized - check config files before asking user\n2. User had to correct an assumption about Chrome MCP\n\n\n3. Added five general-purpose browser tools and expanded the sbs-lsp-mcp tool set from 62 to 67 entries, though the README still needs updating\n4. Executed cleanly with a two-wave plan and no retries needed\n\n**Retrospective 1770188134 (/task crush mode):**\nKey findings:\n1. Crush mode is mature and predictable\n2. Documentation-first wave ordering is good default\n3. No friction points - workflow executed as designed\n4. 4 agents across 2 waves, zero file collisions\n5. 689/689 evergreen tests passed\n\n**Improvement captures:**\n1. Entry 1770184\n\n: During alignment, I should explore the configuration first before asking questions\u2014checking .mcp.json would have been more effective than asking if Chrome MCP exists\n2. Entry 1770187075: The sbs_serve_project MCP tool returns {running: false} without error details when startup fails, forcing the /qa skill to fall back to manual Bash commands\n\n**MCP Analysis findings:**\n\n*Pillar 1 (User Effectiveness):*\n- Alignment efficiency is strong at 100% quick alignment (\u22642 entries)\n- Interruption rate is very low: 2/103 sessions\n- One correction centered on exploration-before-questions approach\n\n*Pillar 2 (Claude Execution):*\n- /task completion rate: 87.2% (41 of 47 invocations completed)\n- Common failure points occur during finalization, execution, and alignment phases\n- /self-improve completion rate: 91.7% with one discovery-phase failure\n- Phase transitions show no backward movement, though 2 planning phases were skipped\n- Execution phases dominate session time at 718.8 seconds average, with about 4.8 entries per /task session\n\n*Pillar 3 (Alignment Patterns):*\n- Plan approval rate is perfect at 100% (31/31)\n- No backward transitions observed\n- Self-improve dialogue phases run unusually long at 1688.9 seconds average compared to other phases\n\n*Pillar 4 (System Engineering):*\n- Quality score coverage remains low at 3.1% (20 of 645 entries)\n- Gate failures: 0 out of 26\n\nLooking at the tag system, there's a large legacy tag set (19 tags) with v2 tags showing weak signal. The v2 tags appear to be applied at the session level rather than per-entry, which explains why most register as neutral with zero signal. The meaningful tags I'm identifying are skill:qa and phase:review, which correlate with error notes.\n\nNow synthesizing across the findings: the first major pattern is that exploration-before-questions isn't yet codified in agent instructions. Both retrospective 1770185443 and improvement capture 1770184492 show the same gap\u2014the agent asked about Chrome MCP availability without first checking .mcp.json. The principle was captured during the session but hasn't made it into the actual instructions yet.\n\nThe serve_project tool is returning unhelpful error messages\u2014just `{running: false}` without explaining the failure reason. This forced a fallback to manual Bash server startup during QA. Task completion is at 87.2%, meaning 12.8% of /task invocations don't finish, with failures clustering around finalization and execution stages. Quality score coverage is critically low at only 3.1%\u2014just 20 entries out of 645 have scores, suggesting validators need to run more frequently. The v2 auto-tags lack meaningful signal differentiation overall.\n\nMost v2 tags show a score of 0.0, appearing uniformly across entries without discriminating between successful and problematic sessions. Tags like `signal:retry-loop`, `signal:consecutive-bash-failures`, and `signal:cli-misfire` appear on 24% of all entries but don't correlate with any gate failures or backward transitions\u2014they're just noise. The self-improve dialogue phase is disproportionately long at 1688.9s average, consuming roughly 90% of the total skill duration, which suggests either excessive refinement discussion or a structural issue with how the phase is organized.

      "content": "Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me synthesize findings, being careful to avoid duplicating existing issues.\n\n**Existing open issues to check for overlap:**\n- #150: crush:ignore label\n- #149: loop opportunities document\n- #148: tactic state toggle\n- #146: IO shorthand for improvement capture\n- #143: Quality score validators into build.py (still open, 3rd cycle flagging this)\n- #142: E2E test for sbs_improvement_capture (still open)\n- #99: Unified taxonomy\n\n**Previous L2 recommendations to follow up on:**\n1. Verify #136 and #137 (documentation consultation) - Both were closed in the crush session (1770188134)\n\n\n2. Track #118 (DuckDB) progress - Not in open issues, presumably still in progress or closed\n3. Verify #143 (build pipeline quality scores) - Still open\n4. Check sbs_improvement_capture usage - Yes, 2 improvement captures were made between cycles\n5. Issue closure verification - Important meta-process gap\n\nNow I'm compiling findings since the last self-improve. The exploration-before-questions principle is validated from the retrospective and improvement capture data, but it hasn't been fully codified yet.  The evidence shows the agent asked about Chrome MCP instead of checking the configuration file first, and the user corrected this. The improvement was captured and #136/#137 address related gaps, though the specific principle about checking runtime state before asking needs to be added to agent instructions\u2014this is distinct from the pre-flight checklist issue. I'm also seeing that sbs_serve_project returns unhelpful errors without explaining why it failed, forcing the QA skill to resort to manual Bash commands. This gap isn't covered by any existing issue.\n\nOn the positive side, task completion is trending upward at 87.2% from 86.7%, with finalization remaining the most common failure point. The quality score coverage metric is stuck at 3.1% for the fourth consecutive cycle, but #143 already tracks this, so no new issue is needed.\n\nThe V2 tags are still showing zero signal across the board\u2014this is a known architectural issue deferred to the DuckDB migration path. Looking at the phase transition data, the self-improve dialogue phase is running significantly longer than other phases at nearly 1689 seconds compared to execution's 719 seconds, which makes sense given that's where findings get discussed and refined, though it might be worth exploring whether limiting the number of findings or enabling parallel refinement could help.\n\nThe tool count in the documentation is stale\u2014it lists 62 tools but we're actually at 67 after adding the browser tools. This is just a docs accuracy issue that should get handled in the update cycle, separate from the agent consultation concerns. On a positive note, the improvement capture tool is actively being used with two captures logged between cycles, which confirms it's functioning as intended and addresses the previous cycle's request to verify adoption.\n\nCrush mode continues to be a reliable pattern\u2014the latest retrospective shows seven issues resolved across four agents in two waves with zero retries or corrections, consistent with previous crush sessions. However, I'm noticing that issue closure verification still hasn't been implemented despite being recommended in the previous L2 review. The metric verification step for the finalization phase was suggested but never actually added, and there's no existing issue tracking this specific gap. Let me check whether the previous recommendations about #136 and #137 actually led to behavioral improvements after they were resolved in the crush session.\n\nLooking at the session history, the exploration-before-questions issue occurred during session 443 before #136 and #137 were even closed. The crush session resolved both of those issues, but there hasn't been a subsequent /task session to verify whether the behavior actually improved. So I can't confirm the fix yet. I'm consolidating the key findings: the exploration-before-questions pattern needs to be codified in agent instructions, the sbs_serve_project tool needs better error messaging instead of failing silently, and metric verification needs to be added to the finalization phase.\n\nBeyond that, quality score coverage is still lagging at 3.1%, the self-improve dialogue phase is taking disproportionately long, and the tool documentation is slightly out of date. But there are some encouraging signals\u2014the improvement capture feature is being used consistently, crush mode is stable, task completion is trending upward, and there haven't been any gate failures or backward transitions. Now I need to move into the selection phase, though I should first deduplicate these findings more carefully.\n\nLooking at what's actually new versus what's already tracked: the explore-before-ask principle isn't covered by any existing issue, the sbs_serve_project finding is novel, and adding metric verification to task finalization is a new suggestion. The quality coverage issue is already being tracked by #143, so that's just a follow-up. The dialogue phase length and documentation staleness are also new observations, though the docs update is pretty trivial.
