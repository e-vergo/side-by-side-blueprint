User Orchestration\n    11\u2192\n    12\u2192**Efficiency: High.** The alignment phase was concise and productive. The user answered 5 multi-choice questions in sequence, each resolving a genuine ambiguity:\n    13\u2192- Build pipeline vs dev tooling scope: \"both equally\"\n    14\u2192- New system vs extend existing: \"extend existing\" (correct call -- avoids new abstractions)\n    15\u2192- Scope: \"measure + optimize\" (not measurement-only)\n    16\u2192- Lake skip strategy: \"auto-detect with --force-lake override\"\n    17\u2192- iCloud sync: \"async fire-and-forget\"\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192**Pattern: Decisive answers, no reversals.** Each question had a clear best answer that the user identified immediately. The git push strategy (\"parallel, at your discretion\") showed appropriate trust delegation -- the user recognized this was an implementation detail rather than a design decision.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192**Observation for L2:** The alignment was efficient because the questions were genuinely orthogonal. None of the answers depended on prior answers. This is a signal that the decomposition was well-structured.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192**Accuracy: High.** The plan was approved without modification on first presentation. No corrections or redirections occurred during any of the 3 execution waves.\n    26\u2192\n    27\u2192**Specific successes:**\n    28\u2192- Wave decomposition (3-3-2 agent distribution) correctly identified dependencies: timing utilities had to exist before other agents could import them\n    29\u2192- File scope partitioning was clean -- zero merge conflicts across 8 parallel agents\n    30\u2192- The decision to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel git pushes (rather than `asyncio`) was sound given the existing synchronous codebase\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**One near-miss:** The task description mentioned \"comprehensive wall-clock time optimization across all workflows\" which could have been interpreted as requiring changes to the Lean build pipeline itself (Lake, SubVerso). The alignment questions correctly scoped this to Python tooling only, avoiding a much larger and riskier task.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192## 3. System Design\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**Build pipeline health:** Evergreen tests passed cleanly (709 tests, 0 failures) after each wave. No gate failures, no retries needed.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192**PR workflow:** PR #157 created and merged via squash strategy. Clean execution.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Parallel execution:** 8 agents ran across 3 waves without collisions:\n    41\u2192- Wave 1 (3 agents): `sbs/core/timing.py`, `sbs/build/config.py` + `orchestrator.py`, `sbs/build/caching.py` -- clean separation by module\n    42\u2192- Wave 2 (3 agents): `sbs/build/orchestrator.py` (skip logic), `sbs/archive/icloud_sync.py` + `upload.py`, `sbs/archive/upload.py` (parallel pushes) -- potential overlap on `upload.py` was resolved by sequential dependency in the plan\n    43\u2192- Wave 3 (2 agents): Tests + validators, docs + visualization -- zero overlap\n    44\u2192\n    45\u2192**Observation:** The 856-line addition across 11 files in a single task is on the larger side. The wave structure kept it manageable, but tasks of this scope benefit from the 3-wave maximum to maintain coherence.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192**Adherence: Complete.** All 3 waves executed as planned with no mid-flight adjustments needed.\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192**Deliverables matched plan:**\n    52\u2192- TimingContext context manager with `format_duration` and `timing_summary` utilities\n    53\u2192- `--force-lake` CLI flag with auto-detect skip logic via Lean source hashing\n    54\u2192- `async_full_sync()` for fire-and-forget iCloud sync\n    55\u2192- `ThreadPoolExecutor`-based parallel git pushes in `ensure_porcelain()`\n    56\u2192- Extended timing validator for archive timing metrics\n    57\u2192- 20 new evergreen tests covering all optimization features\n    58\u2192- Archive timing visualization chart\n    59\u2192- Updated documentation in `dev/storage/README.md`\n    60\u2192\n    61\u2192**Test coverage:** The new `test_timing_optimization.py` file provides 20 tests, all evergreen-tier. Total test count grew from 689 to 709.\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192- **Infrastructure optimization tasks are well-suited to the /task workflow.** The scope was clear, the changes were isolated to Python tooling, and the testing infrastructure caught issues early. No Lean compilation needed.\n    66\u2192- **The 3-wave maximum is a good constraint.** This task fit naturally into 3 waves with clear dependency ordering. Attempting to flatten into fewer waves would have created file collisions; more waves would have been unnecessary overhead.\n    67\u2192- **Auto-tag analysis of the handoff entry:** The entry was tagged with `signal:consecutive-bash-failures`, `signal:retry-loop`, and `signal:high-churn`. These tags likely come from the early expl",

User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192**Efficiency: Very High.** The crush triage was presented as a structured table of 10 candidate issues with recommended actions. The user approved all 8 recommended resolutions immediately with no modifications, and accepted the \"investigate-only\" recommendation for #148. This is the fastest alignment phase observed for a multi-issue task.\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192**Pattern: Trust-based batch approval.** The user's immediate approval of all recommendations suggests the triage presentation format (table with issue/type/action/wave columns) was effective. No back-and-forth was needed because the recommendations matched user expectations.\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192**IO shorthand adoption:** Mid-finalization, the user sent \"IO\" -- the exact shorthand we had just documented in #146 during this session. Immediate adoption of a convention defined minutes earlier is a strong signal that the documentation matched an existing user mental model.\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192**Observation:** Crush mode works best when the orchestrator presents a pre-filtered, prioritized batch. The user's role reduces to approve/reject/modify, which is the appropriate level of engagement for low-complexity issues.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192**Accuracy: High.** The plan was approved without modification. All 5 waves executed as planned with no mid-flight adjustments.\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192**Specific successes:**\n    26\u2192- Wave 0 (investigation) correctly identified #148 as requiring upstream SubVerso changes, preventing wasted effort on a Runway-only fix\n    27\u2192- Wave grouping (trivial CSS / error messages / docs / code) naturally separated concerns and prevented file collisions\n    28\u2192- The `crush:ignore` taxonomy label (#150) was a clean addition -- single YAML edit with no code changes needed\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**One process issue:** An agent used `gh issue comment` without `--repo` flag, posting to PNT instead of SBS. This is a recurring pattern with `gh` CLI when the working directory is inside a showcase project. The fix is mechanical (always pass `--repo e-vergo/Side-By-Side-Blueprint`) but the error was caught only by inspection, not by any automated check.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Test quality concern:** The #142 agent wrote tests for `sbs_improvement_capture` that simulate the MCP tool's logic inline rather than calling the actual function. These verify internal logic but may not catch integration issues (e.g., archive path resolution, file permission problems). The tests pass but their coverage claims are weaker than they appear.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192## 3. System Design\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**Build pipeline health:** All gates passed cleanly:\n    37\u2192- 709/709 evergreen tests (0 failures)\n    38\u2192- 15/15 taxonomy validation\n    39\u2192- 31/31 MCP skill tests\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**PR workflow:** PR #158 created and merged via squash. Clean execution.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192**Parallel execution:** 4 waves of paired agents (8 agents total) ran without file collisions. The wave structure:\n    44\u2192- Wave 0: Single investigation agent (#148)\n    45\u2192- Wave 1: CSS removal (#156) + serve errors (#153)\n    46\u2192- Wave 2: Metric verification (#154) + explore-before-ask (#152)\n    47\u2192- Wave 3: Taxonomy label (#150) + MCP tests (#142)\n    48\u2192- Wave 4: IO shorthand (#146) + build validator (#143)\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192**MCP repo testing gap:** The sbs-lsp-mcp repo has its own venv at `forks/sbs-lsp-mcp/.venv/bin/pytest`. The standard `sbs_run_tests` MCP tool doesn't cover this. Agents had to discover and run tests manually. This is a known friction point but not yet automated.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192**Adherence: Complete.** All 5 waves executed as planned. No deviations, no blocked agents, no retries needed.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192**Deliverables matched plan:**\n    57\u2192- #156: `display: none` on `.top-bar` in common.css\n    58\u2192- #153: `error` field added to `ServeResult` model, populated on server start failures\n    59\u2192- #154: Runtime state checks added to finalization gate in SKILL.md\n    60\u2192- #152: \"Explore-before-ask\" section added to sbs-developer.md\n    61\u2192- #150: `crush:ignore` label added to taxonomy.yaml\n    62\u2192- #142: 5 pytest tests for improvement_capture in test_skill_tools.py\n    63\u2192- #146: IO shorthand section added to CLAUDE.md\n    64\u2192- #143: Quality validator integration in build orchestrator\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192**Files changed:** 9 files, +233/-9 lines.

No post-closure /task session to verify yet. |\n    32\u2192| #137 (consult docs before coding) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to sbs-developer.md. No post-closure session to verify. |\n    33\u2192| #138 (defer auto-tagger to DuckDB) | Closed (crush) | Policy decision.

These are easy to close but hard to verify -- they require subsequent sessions to demonstrate behavioral change. None of the 6 have been verified yet because the crush session was the most recent /task invocation.\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192---\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192## Cross-Session Patterns\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192### Pattern 1: Guidance Additions Accumulate Without Verification\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192Cycles 2-4 have produced 14 guidance additions to SKILL.md and agent files. Only 2 have been verified (the crush triage pattern from #127, and the exploration-then-plan pattern from general observation). The rest are assumed effective because they were closed.\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192This is the same \"closure != resolution\" pattern identified in cycle 3, but applied to process guidance rather than metrics. Adding words to a SKILL.md doesn't guarantee agents read and follow them -- the same failure mode that prompted #136 (agents not reading Known Limitations).\n    53\u2192\n    54\u2192### Pattern 2: Improvement Captures Are Working\n    55\u2192\n    56\u2192Two `sbs_improvement_capture` entries were created between cycles, both containing actionable observations that fed directly into this cycle's findings. This validates the zero-friction capture workflow introduced in cycle 3. The tool is being used as intended.\n    57\u2192\n    58\u2192### Pattern 3: Execution Quality Continues Upward Trend\n    59\u2192\n    60\u2192| Metric | Cycle 2 | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 |\n    61\u2192|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n    62\u2192| Task completion | 85.7% | 86.7% | 87.2% |\n    63\u2192| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n    64\u2192| Gate failures | 0/22 | 0/26 | 0/26 |\n    65\u2192| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n    66\u2192| Interruption rate | 1/97 | 2/103 | 2/103 |\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192The crush session (#7 issues, 4 agents, 0 retries) and QA skill session (#144, 2 agents, 0 retries) both show clean execution. The process is maturing.\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192### Pattern 4: Persistent Metrics Remain Unmoved\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192Quality score coverage: 3.1% (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Tag signal scores: 0.0 (cycles 1-4, unchanged). Both have been acknowledged as architectural problems requiring structural solutions (#143 for quality, DuckDB for tags). Until those are implemented, these metrics will remain static.\n    73\u2192\n    74\u2192---\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192## Per-Pillar Synthesis",

Result: 197 entries in the current epoch carry the same ~20 v2 tags. Tags like `signal:retry-loop` and `signal:consecutive-bash-failures` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate, not the individual entry.\n\nThis makes per-entry analysis impossible \u2014 tags can't differentiate normal phases from problem phases within a session.\n\n## Evidence\n\n- Entry 1770192056 retrospective: \"The auto-tagger may be over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns\"\n- Tag effectiveness analysis: All v2 tags have 0.0 signal score (no correlation with gate failures, backward transitions, or error notes)\n- 182/197 v2-era entries carry `signal:consecutive-bash-failures`, `signal:same-command-retry`, `outcome:had-retries` uniformly\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\nEither:\n1. **Entry-aware tagging:** Compute tags from the delta since last entry (new tool calls, new errors, phase transitions)\n2. **Tag namespace split:** Separate `session:*` tags (computed once per session, inherited by all entries) from `entry:*` tags (computed per-entry from phase/transition/notes context)\n\nOption 2 is cleaner and backward-compatible. Related to DuckDB migration but can be addressed independently.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nAfter fix, entries within the same session have different tag sets based on their phase/transition content.",

Auto-tagger flagged clean execution as problematic. Alignment was efficient due to orthogonal questions. |\n| 1770193776 | /task crush (8 issues: #156, #153, #154, #152, #150, #142, #146, #143) | Fastest alignment ever for multi-issue task. IO shorthand adopted immediately. `gh` CLI repo inference bug observed. Test simulation anti-pattern identified. |\n\n## Improvement Captures Reviewed\n\n| Entry ID | Category | Observation |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| 1770193719 | tooling | MCP repo tests require project-specific venv; sbs_run_tests can't reach them. |\n\n---\n\n## Previous Cycle Follow-Up\n\n| Issue | Status | Outcome |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| #152 (explore-before-ask) | Closed (crush) | Guidance added to sbs-developer.md. Not yet verified in practice. |\n| #153 (serve tool errors) | Closed (crush) | Error field added to ServeResult. Not yet verified via /qa. |\n| #154 (metric verification in finalization) | Closed (crush) | Runtime state checks added to SKILL.md. Not yet verified. |\n| #142 (e2e test for improvement_capture) | Closed (crush) | 5 tests added, but retrospective notes they are simulation tests, not integration. |\n| #143 (quality validators in build.py) | Closed (crush) | Quality validator integration added. No build run since to verify coverage improvement. |\n\n**Closure rate for cycle 4 issues:** 5/5 remaining issues all closed (100% cumulative). However, 0/5 have been verified in subsequent sessions.\n\n**Key finding:** The crush session cleared the entire backlog from cycle 4, but verification remains pending for all items. This extends the guidance verification debt pattern identified in cycle 4.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Session Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Auto-Tag Uniformity Within Sessions\n\nAll 197 v2-era entries carry the same ~20 tags because the auto-tagger computes from session-level metadata (token counts, tool distribution, model). Tags like `signal:retry-loop` appear on clean execution entries because they describe the session aggregate. This has been true for multiple cycles but this is the first time a retrospective explicitly flagged it as misleading (\"over-sensitive to normal exploration patterns\").\n\nThe tag system currently serves as a session classifier, not an entry classifier. This distinction hasn't been articulated before.\n\n### Pattern 2: Crush Mode is a Mature, Reliable Pattern\n\nTwo consecutive sessions (#155 feature task, then crush) both executed cleanly with no retries, no collisions, and 100% plan approval. The crush specifically: 8 issues, 5 waves, 8 agents, 0 corrections. The triage-table presentation format enables fast approval. Crush mode has crossed from \"experimental\" to \"standard operating procedure.\"\n\n### Pattern 3: Guidance Verification Debt is Compounding\n\n| Cycle | Guidance additions | Verified |\n|-------|-------------------|----------|\n| 2 | ~5 | 2 |\n| 3 | ~5 | 0 |\n| 4 | 3 | 0 |\n| 5 (crush closures) | 8 | 0 |\n| **Total** | **~21** | **2** |\n\nThis is the most concerning cross-session pattern. 90%+ of guidance additions remain unverified. The self-improve cycle creates recommendations, which get closed via code/doc changes, but there's no feedback loop confirming behavioral change. Issue #164 addresses this.\n\n### Pattern 4: Execution Metrics Continue Stable\n\n| Metric | Cycle 3 | Cycle 4 | Cycle 5 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Task completion | 86.7% | 87.2% | 87.8% |\n| Backward transitions | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Gate failures | 0/26 | 0/26 | 0/28 |\n| Plan approval | 100% | 100% | 100% |\n| Interruption rate | 2/103 | 2/103 | 2/109 |\n\nAll operational metrics are stable or improving slightly. The system is in steady state for execution quality.\n\n---\n\n## Per-Pillar Synthesis\n\n### Pillar 1: User Effectiveness\n\n**L1 observations:** User continues efficient and decisive. Task #155: 5 orthogonal questions, all answered immediately. Crush: single triage proposal, instant approval. IO shorthand adopted within minutes of documentation.\n\n**MCP findings:** 100% quick alignment. 2/109 interruptions (stable). Improvement capture tool used once between cycles.\n\n**Synthesis:** Strongest pillar, unchanged. The IO shorthand adoption is a positive signal that convention documentation matches user mental models. No issues logged for this pillar.\n\n### Pillar 2: Claude Execution\n\n**L1 observations:** Zero-retry execution in both sessions. Auto-tags flagged clean sessions as problematic (false positive signal). Test simulation anti-pattern identified.\n\n**MCP findings:** Task completion 87.8%. Self-improve dialogue phase long (1556s avg) but this cycle used batched review successfully. Finalization remains most common failure substate.\n\n**Synthesis:** Two findings logged: #161 (gh CLI repo inference) and #162 (test simulation pattern). Both are about precision of agent work, not volume. The system executes reliably but produces occasional wrong-target or weak-test outputs.\n\n### Pillar 3: Alignment Patterns\n\n**L1 observations:** 100% plan approval in both sessions. No mid-execution adjustments. Metric verification gap from cycle 4 was addressed (#154 closed) but not yet verified.\n\n**MCP findings:** 33/33 plans reached execution. 0 backward transitions. 2 historical skipped planning phases (not recent).\n\n**Synthesis:** One finding logged: #164 (guidance verification protocol). This is a meta-process improvement \u2014 the alignment mechanisms work, but we can't prove it because verification is absent.\n\n### Pillar 4: System Engineering\n\n**L1 observations:** 709/709 evergreen tests pass. MCP repo testing gap identified. Quality validator integration implemented but unverified.\n\n**MCP findings:** Quality score coverage 3.0% (unchanged, but #143 fix hasn't been exercised via build yet). 0 gate failures. Tags still 0.0 signal score uniformly.\n\n**Synthesis:** Two findings logged: #160 (tag uniformity) and #163 (MCP repo test support). Both are observation-layer improvements. The infrastructure itself is reliable; the monitoring/analysis tools need refinement to provide actionable signals.\n\n---\n\n## Behavioral Observations\n\n### Finding Depth Continues Increasing\n\n| Cycle | Findings | Nature |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | 7 | Surface-level process gaps |\n| 2 | 7 | Structural improvements |\n| 3 | 8 | Tooling and verification gaps |\n| 4 | 3 | Deeper observation (metric verification, error messages) |\n| 5 | 5 | Meta-process (verification protocol), precision issues (test quality, tag granularity) |\n\nThe findings are shifting from \"things that are broken\" to \"things that appear to work but have subtle quality gaps.\" This is a healthy maturation trajectory.\n\n### Batched Dialogue Phase Confirmed Effective\n\nThis cycle presented all 5 findings in a single batch with one confirmation prompt. Previous cycle experimented with this; user approved without modification, confirming batched review is the preferred approach. Self-improve dialogue avg should decrease in future cycles.\n\n### L2-to-L2 Trend\n\nCycle 4 recommended tracking this. Updated:\n\n| Cycle | Issues logged | All closed? | Verified? |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1 | 7 | Yes | 2/7 |\n| 2 | 7 | Yes | Unknown |\n| 3 | 8 | Yes (75% by cycle 4, 100% by cycle 5) | ~2/8 |\n| 4 | 3 | Yes (closed in crush) | 0/3 |\n| 5 | 5 | Pending | N/A |\n\nThe closure pipeline is efficient (all issues eventually get closed). The verification pipeline is the bottleneck. Issue #164 is the structural fix.\n\n---\n\n## Findings Logged\n\n| # | Issue | Pillar | Impact |\n|---|-------|--------|--------|\n| #160 | V2 auto-tags session-level, not entry-level | System Engineering | High |\n| #161 | Add --repo flag guidance for gh CLI | Claude Execution | High |\n| #162 | Agent testing anti-pattern: simulation over integration | Claude Execution | Medium |\n| #163 | Extend sbs_run_tests for MCP repo venv | System Engineering | Medium |\n| #164 | Establish guidance verification protocol | Alignment Patterns | Medium |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Next Cycle\n\n1. **Run a build and check quality coverage.** #143 was implemented; a build should produce quality-scored entries. If coverage jumps, the fix worked. If not, investigate.\n2. **Begin guidance verification sampling** per #164. Pick 2-3 additions from cycles 2-3 and check session transcripts for adoption evidence.\n3. **Track #161 and #162** \u2014 both are agent guidance additions that will themselves need verification. Meta-irony: they add to the verification debt they help address.\n4. **Observe tag behavior after #160 is implemented.** If entry-level tags are introduced, re-run tag effectiveness analysis to see if signal scores improve.\n5. **L2-to-L2 trend:** Finding count stable (5), finding depth increasing. System is in refinement mode, not emergency mode.\n"

The skill specifically asks for retrospectives newer than the last self-improve, so I'm looking for IDs greater than 1770188948.\n\nLet me pull up these two retrospectives and start the parallel analysis tools.",

      "content": "Now I have a comprehensive picture. Let me synthesize findings:\n\n**Retrospectives reviewed (since last self-improve):**\n1. 1770192056 - /task #155 Wall-Clock Time Optimization\n2. 1770193776 - /task crush 8 issues\n\n**Improvement captures (new since last self-improve):**\n1. 1770193719 - MCP repo tests require project-specific venv\n\n**Previous cycle recommendations to follow up on:**\n1. Verify guidance additions (14 unverified)\n2. Track #143 and #153\n3. Verify #154 in practice\n\n\n4. Observe improvement capture usage\n5. L2-to-L2 trend tracking\n\nLooking at the retrospectives, I'm seeing strong patterns in user effectiveness. Task #155 showed a really tight alignment phase with five clear multi-choice questions that got answered immediately without any backtracking, suggesting solid trust in the delegation approach. The crush session was even faster\u2014the triage table format clicked right away and the user picked up the IO shorthand immediately. Across both sessions, structured formats consistently drive efficient engagement, which points to user effectiveness being the strongest pillar overall.\n\nOn the execution side, the agent coordination is solid\u2014Task #155 ran 8 agents across 3 waves with no collisions and 856 lines across 11 files, while the crush session managed 8 agents across 5 waves cleanly. The auto-tagger is flagging signals like consecutive bash failures and retry loops, but the retrospectives suggest these might just be normal exploration patterns rather than actual problems. The auto-tagger seems to be over-sensitive to what's actually routine behavior during development.\n\nThere's also a testing concern from the crush retrospective\u2014agents are writing tests that verify their own logic rather than catching real integration issues, which means the test coverage might be giving false confidence. On alignment, both sessions hit 100% plan approval with no mid-execution pivots, and the near-miss in Task #155 was correctly handled through alignment questions before it became a scope creep issue.\n\nLooking at the previous cycle's action item around verifying metric verification in Task #154\u2014it was resolved in the crush session, but the finalization entry doesn't have a quality_score recorded, so I can't actually confirm the verification happened in practice. The guidance was documented but the actual verification step is still unconfirmed. The evergreen tests are solid across both sessions, though there's still a gap in testing coverage for the MCP repository.\n\nThe quality score tracking is severely limited at only 3%, and the signal tags aren't providing any differentiation since every entry has identical tags. There's also a recurring issue with the `gh` CLI where agents forget the `--repo` flag and post to the wrong repository\u2014this has happened multiple times and needs to be documented as a known gotcha. uniformity) is a system issue that's been there, finding 2 (gh CLI bug) is new and actionable, finding 3 (agent test pattern) is a Claude behavior observation. For the medium-impact ones, finding 4 is a known gap, finding 5 is a persistent blocker that needs attention, and finding 6 is a follow-up on previous guidance work. Finding 7 is positive validation. I should separate these into new issues versus existing tracking items to prioritize what needs immediate action. Now I'm checking which cycle 4 recommendations were actually resolved in the crush session\u2014looking at the closed issues like #156, #153, #154, and others. I see #143 about quality validator integration was closed, but the system health metric is still at 3.0% (20/674), likely because no new builds have run since the fix to generate updated quality scores.\n\nBoth #143 and #142 from the previous cycle were successfully closed in the crush, so those recommendations are resolved. Now I'm organizing the key findings into a clear format, starting with the most actionable ones like the session-level auto-tagging issue.\n\nThe V2 auto-tagger computes tags from session metadata that stays constant across entries, so it can't distinguish between normal and problem phases within a single session\u2014a medium-impact architectural limitation. The `gh` CLI has a gotcha where it targets the wrong repository when the agent is working inside showcase projects, which has happened multiple times and needs explicit guidance in the developer docs. Agents also tend to write tests that simulate tool behavior rather than actually calling the functions, which I saw in the improvement_capture tests\u2014they understand the logic but don't integrate with real implementations.\n\nThe MCP test runner can't reach tests in forks without manual venv discovery, creating friction for development work. There's also growing debt around guidance verification: over 20 unverified guidance additions across recent cycles with no systematic way to confirm agents actually follow them. The quality validator integration from the crush session hasn't been verified yet since no build has run since implementation.\n\nNow I'm moving on to selection.",
