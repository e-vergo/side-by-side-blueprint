Chrome's DevTools can be used to change HTML and CSS in the browser and see results, and now there are extensions that integrate Chrome and Edge DevTools into Visual Studio so that changes can be saved back into the application.\n\n## Python Playwright Overview\n\nPlaywright is a Python library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API. The library provides capabilities for CSS manipulation and page control, including the ability to add a `<link rel=\"stylesheet\">` tag or a `<style>` tag with CSS content, returning the added tag when the stylesheet's onload fires or when the CSS content was injected.\n\n## Hot Reload Development Challenges\n\nThere are ongoing discussions in the Playwright community about hot reload efficiency. Developers have reported that every time code changes are made and a hot reload is expected, Playwright restarts the browser instance and re-executes the entire test workflow from the beginning, which significantly slows down the development cycle.\n\nThe search results show integration of browser DevTools with development environments and various Playwright capabilities for CSS handling, though there isn't specific information about a unified hot reload solution for CSS live editing with Playwright in 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Visual Regression Testing (Best Immediate Fit)\n\n**Percy** (https://github.com/percy):\n- Cloud-based visual testing platform by BrowserStack\n- CLI via `@percy/cli` npm package\n- GitHub integration: Updates PR status automatically\n- **Fit**: Could integrate into existing screenshot workflow, provide automated diffs on PRs\n\n**Open-Source Alternatives** (BackstopJS, SnapAndCompare):\n- Self-hosted visual regression tools\n- **Fit**: Could enhance existing `sbs capture` + `sbs compliance` workflow\n\n#### 2. Design-to-Code Workflows\n\n**Figma Code Connect**:\n- Links Figma design components to code via CLI\n- GitHub integration for repository access\n- **Fit**: Would require design-first workflow (mockups before implementation)\n- Figma MCP server available for Claude integration\n\n**Design Tokens Export**:\n- Export design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) from Figma\n- CLI-friendly, works with version control\n- **Fit**: Could solve CSS variable consistency issues (relates to T6 validator)\n\n#### 3. Browser DevTools Automation\n\n**Playwright + CSS Injection**:\n- Can inject CSS via `page.add_style_tag()`\n- Python-native, already in our stack\n- **Fit**: Could enable live CSS iteration without rebuilds\n- Challenge: Hot reload is slow (browser restarts on code changes)\n\n#### 4. Diagram-Based Communication\n\n**Excalidraw/Mermaid**:\n- Collaborative whiteboard with hand-drawn aesthetic\n- Can import from Mermaid diagrams (text \u2192 visual)\n- **Fit**: Good for wireframes/layout sketches, less for precise CSS\n\n**SVG Wireframes**:\n- Generate SVG wireframes from text descriptions\n- Lightweight, no external tools needed\n- **Fit**: Could work for quick iteration, but low fidelity\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n#### Tier 1: Implement Now (Low Hanging Fruit)\n\n1. **Enhance existing screenshot workflow with automated diffing**\n   - Integrate SnapAndCompare or similar into `sbs capture`\n   - Generate visual diffs automatically, not just pass/fail\n   - Store diffs in archive alongside screenshots\n\n2. **Add Playwright CSS hot-swapping for rapid iteration**\n   - Create dev mode that injects CSS changes without rebuild\n   - Use `page.add_style_tag()` to test CSS tweaks live\n   - Save successful changes back to source files\n\n3. **SVG wireframe protocol for layout discussions**\n   - Establish convention: user provides SVG sketch for complex layouts\n   - Can use ChatGPT, Excalidraw, or hand-coded SVG\n   - Commit wireframes to repo alongside implementation\n\n#### Tier 2: Evaluate (Medium Investment)\n\n4. **Figma \u2192 Design Tokens workflow**\n   - Prototype exporting CSS variables from Figma\n   - Test if this improves color/spacing consistency (T6 validator)\n\n5. **Percy or open-source visual regression in CI**\n   - Add visual regression checks to GitHub Actions\n   - Block PRs if visual changes aren't approved\n\n#### Tier 3: Consider Later (High Investment)\n\n6. **Full Figma-first workflow**\n   - User creates mockups in Figma before implementation\n   - Export via Code Connect or Visual Copilot\n\n---\n\n### Immediate Next Steps\n\n1. Prototype Playwright CSS hot-swap (quick win, uses existing tech stack)\n2. Test SnapAndCompare integration (enhance current `sbs capture`)\n3. Establish SVG wireframe convention (zero-cost communication improvement)\n4. Research Figma MCP integration (explore if Figma MCP fits Claude Code workflow)\n\n---\n\n**Research Sources**: Percy, Chromatic, SnapAndCompare, Figma Code Connect, Playwright Python API, Excalidraw, Mermaid-to-Excalidraw, Chrome DevTools Protocol documentation\nEOF\n)\"",

Here's a summary of the relevant findings:\n\n## Lean Theorem Prover\n\nLean is a functional programming language and theorem prover built for formalizing math and for formal verification, but is flexible enough for general coding. In 2021, Lean 4 was released, which was a reimplementation of the Lean theorem prover capable of producing C code which is then compiled, enabling the development of efficient domain-specific automation.\n\n## Syntax Highlighting for Lean\n\nOne notable area of development involves syntax highlighting for Lean on different platforms. Eric Wieser created a PR to Linguist for the Lean 4 grammar so that we can have Lean 4 syntax highlighting on GitHub. However, there have been challenges with this integration.\n\n## Static Site Generators\n\nRegarding static site generators with syntax highlighting capabilities, one concrete example is luasmith. Adding new grammars simply required writing some Lua code, using the LPeg library. Luasmith now supports syntax highlighting for ~150 languages, thanks to Scintillua--and it only increased the gzipped download by about 180 KB!\n\n## Recent Lean Community Activity\n\nLean Together is an annual meeting for users, developers, and fans of the Lean programming language and theorem prover and its library Mathlib maintained by the Lean Community.\n\nThe search results show active development in both syntax highlighting capabilities for Lean and innovation in static site generators, though no specific projects directly combining all three elements in 2026 were found.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standards.\n\n## Interactive Mathematical Proof Visualization\n\nA particularly relevant finding is **Treehehe**, a specific project that combines the elements you're interested in: The main D3 work is in treehehe/Resources/scripts/d3tree.js. The main goal of the project is to provide a tool for visualizing proof trees and providing a walk-through of the reasoning process. The initial motivation is to help beginners on their journey of understanding logic.\n\n## D3.js Capabilities\n\nD3 facilitates exploration with reusable interactive behaviors, including panning, zooming, brushing, and dragging. This makes it well-suited for interactive documentation of complex concepts like mathematical proofs.\n\nThe search results show that D3.js is extensively used for creating interactive visualizations, and there are already examples of its application in mathematical proof visualization, though the specific 2026 developments or frameworks weren't prominently featured in these results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

For custom extensibility:\n\n- You can change the highlighting theme by passing the theme field in prism in your docusaurus.config.js, or write your own theme if not satisfied with the default.\n- To add syntax highlighting for languages not yet supported by Prism, you can swizzle prism-include-languages.\n- Docusaurus leverages Prism.js under the hood, supporting 300+ languages via proper aliases.\n\n## MkDocs\n\nWhile MkDocs may not be as extensible as Sphinx, it is an excellent choice for teams looking for a quick, efficient way to publish documentation. If you're considering using Sphinx because you need to generate reference documentation, you should give mkdocstrings a try \u2013 an actively maintained and popular framework building on top of MkDocs.\n\n## Sphinx\n\nSphinx offers robust extensibility through various plugins and themes. Sphinx uses reStructuredText or Markdown as its markup language, supports multiple output formats, extensive cross references, hierarchical structure, code handling, and built-in extensions. Plus, user-contributed extensions make it the documentation system of choice.\n\nFor 2026, Docusaurus, Sphinx, and MkDocs are among the most popular documentation tools, each with different strengths in extensibility and code highlighting capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Using PreTeXt as the source, books can be produced in multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, ePUB) and now Braille.\n\n## Quarto\n\nQuarto builds on Pandoc markdown which has excellent support for LaTeX equations and citations, and adds extensions for cross-references, figure panels, callouts, advanced page layout, and more. Quarto supports LaTeX style equation writing, including both inline and display form equations, as well as numbering equations.\n\nBoth frameworks are designed to handle mathematical documentation effectively, with PreTeXt being specifically tailored for mathematical textbooks and educational materials, while Quarto is a more general-purpose technical publishing platform that also handles mathematical content well.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Here are the key findings regarding React, Vue, Svelte, documentation sites, and programmatic generation APIs in 2026:\n\n## Framework Trends in 2026\n\nIn 2026, the major JavaScript frameworks are converging around four themes - fine-grained reactivity, server-first rendering, compiler-driven optimizations (with TypeScript as the baseline), and AI-assisted workflows.\n\n## Programmatic Generation and AI Integration\n\nCurrent capabilities include scaffolding new pages, components, or routes that follow a known pattern in React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, or Svelte, porting components between frameworks when clear examples are provided, and generating tests, types, and basic docs for APIs you've already designed.\n\nGenerative UI is the process of connecting the results of a tool call to a React component, enabling interfaces that adapt based on conversation flow and AI responses.\n\n## Framework-Specific Developments\n\n**React**: React 19's compiler cuts unnecessary re-renders by about 25-40% and Server Components can shrink initial render time from roughly 2.4s to 0.8s.\n\n**Vue**: Vue's documentation is described as a masterpiece, and Vue's enterprise adoption has grown 45% year-over-year.\n\n**Svelte**: SvelteKit hit its 2.0 release in mid-December, and as of October, the Svelte maintainers were publicly planning for a \"near future\" version of SvelteKit that takes advantage of Svelte's new features.\n\nThe search results focus more on framework performance, features, and AI-assisted development workflows rather than specific APIs for programmatic documentation site generation, which may not be a prominent topic in recent 2026 discussions.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

After installing Lean 4, mathlib4 can be compiled, and then the doc-gen4 tool can be used to generate documentation in HTML format.\n\n## Static Site Generation\n\nThe root of the built docs will be docbuild/.lake/build/doc/index.html. The mathlib4_docs repository is responsible for generating and publishing the mathlib4 docs, and the HTML files can be found in .lake/build/doc.\n\n## Working with mathlib4\n\nWhen working with mathlib4 specifically, if you depend on mathlib4 run MATHLIB_NO_CACHE_ON_UPDATE=1 lake update doc-gen4 instead to mitigate a small issue in mathlib's caching mechanism.\n\n## Important Note\n\nDue to the \"Same Origin Policy\", the generated website will be partially broken if you just open the generated html files in your browser. This is an important consideration when working with the locally-generated static sites.\n\nThe search results provide technical documentation from the official GitHub repositories and Lean documentation sites, but don't contain information specifically dated to 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Hugo and Content Generation with APIs (2026)\n\nHugo, a static site generator, pairs effectively with headless CMS platforms to create efficient, scalable technical blogs, particularly in 2026 with advancements in API-driven content management.\n\n### API-Driven Content Integration\n\nContentful is a leading headless CMS that provides a scalable solution for enterprise-level blogs and content-heavy websites. As of 2026, Contentful's latest stable version is 10.11.0, with robust API support and enhanced performance features. It allows developers to pull data from Contentful into Markdown or YAML files for Hugo using the contentful-hugo CLI tool.\n\nSanity.io is a flexible headless CMS that offers real-time previews and collaboration features, making it ideal for teams that require seamless content editing and previewing. As of 2026, Sanity.io's latest version is 3.19.0, with enhanced real-time editing and AI-powered content agent features.\n\n## Jekyll Plugin Architecture\n\nJekyll has a plugin system with hooks that allow you to create custom generated content specific to your site. You can run custom code for your site without having to modify the Jekyll source itself.\n\nYou can create a generator when you need Jekyll to create additional content based on your own rules. A generator is a subclass of Jekyll::Generator that defines a generate method, which receives an instance of Jekyll::Site.\n\n## API-Driven Features in Static Sites\n\nToday's major static site generators all include the ability to generate content from JSON data files. They also provide functions you can use to fetch content from an API and use with this feature. Hugo (my static site generator of choice) provides the getJSON function. Jekyll has a third-party plugin, jekyll_get.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks.",

Documentation Frameworks\n\n**Docusaurus** (https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks):\n- React-based, Prism syntax highlighting (300+ languages)\n- Custom highlighting via theme swizzling\n- Strong plugin ecosystem\n- **Fit**: Would need custom Lean grammar for Prism + D3 component wrappers\n- **Challenge**: Markdown-first (Runway generates HTML, not MD)\n\n**MkDocs + mkdocstrings** (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/):\n- Python-native, fast iteration\n- Less extensible than Sphinx but simpler\n- **Fit**: Python integration good for build scripts\n- **Challenge**: Still markdown-centric, would lose Lean generation\n\n**Sphinx** (https://satisfyhost.com/blog/best-software-documentation-tools-open-source/):\n- Robust extensibility, multiple output formats\n- Supports reStructuredText or Markdown\n- **Fit**: Highly customizable for technical docs\n- **Challenge**: Heavy, complex plugin architecture\n\n#### 2. Academic/Mathematical Frameworks\n\n**PreTeXt** (https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/pretext-guide.pdf):\n- XML source, multiple outputs (HTML, PDF, ePUB, Braille)\n- Built for mathematical textbooks\n- Uses MathJax for LaTeX equations\n- **Fit**: Designed for our domain (math proofs)\n- **Challenge**: XML-based (not Lean-native), would need custom conversion\n\n**Quarto** (https://quarto.org/):\n- General-purpose technical publishing\n- Excellent LaTeX support, Pandoc markdown\n- **Fit**: Strong math support, multiple outputs\n- **Challenge**: Markdown-first, doesn't integrate with Lean code generation\n\n#### 3. Static Site Generators\n\n**Hugo** (https://dasroot.net/posts/2026/01/hugo-headless-cms-best-combinations-technical-blogs/):\n- Fast build times, `getJSON` function for API-driven content\n- Can pull from headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity)\n- **Fit**: Could consume JSON from Lean, fast builds\n- **Challenge**: Go templates unfamiliar, still needs content transformation layer\n\n**Jekyll** (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/generators/):\n- Ruby-based, custom generators via plugins\n- `jekyll_get` plugin for API data\n- **Fit**: Plugin system allows custom content generation\n- **Challenge**: Ruby ecosystem, slower than Hugo\n\n#### 4. Modern Framework-Based Generators\n\n**VitePress** (https://olets.dev/posts/migrate-from-vuepress-to-vitepress/):\n- Vue-based, Vite build system (fast)\n- Async chunk loading, automatic CSS extraction\n- **Fit**: Modern, fast, Vue component ecosystem for D3\n- **Challenge**: Still markdown-centric, would need custom content pipeline\n\n**Astro** (https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/):\n- Multi-framework support (React, Vue, Svelte)\n- Island architecture (partial hydration)\n- MDX support with custom plugins\n- **Fit**: Very flexible, could embed D3 components easily\n- **Challenge**: Would need to transform Runway output to Astro components\n\n**SvelteKit** (https://medium.com/@vignarajj/sveltekit-vs-react-vue-angular-and-other-front-end-frameworks-why-sveltekit-stands-out-cfa19ce704fe):\n- Compiler-driven optimization, lean output\n- 2.0 release in late 2024\n- **Fit**: Performance-focused, good for interactive graphs\n- **Challenge**: Newer ecosystem, less documentation tooling\n\n#### 5. Lean Ecosystem Tools\n\n**doc-gen4** (https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4):\n- Official Lean 4 documentation generator\n- Generates HTML from Lean code\n- Used for mathlib4 docs (https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/)\n- **Fit**: Native Lean integration, already understands Lean syntax\n- **Challenge**: Generic API docs, not designed for theorem/proof narratives\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation Matrix\n\n| Framework | Lean Integration | Syntax Highlighting | D3.js Support | Programmatic Generation | Migration Effort |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Docusaurus** | Custom | Prism (extensible) | React components | Medium | High |\n| **MkDocs** | Custom | Pygments | Plugin/JS | Medium | High |\n| **Sphinx** | Custom | Pygments | Extensions | High | Very High |\n| **PreTeXt** | None | MathJax only | Custom | Low | Very High |\n| **Quarto** | None | Pandoc | Embedded | Low | Very High |\n| **Hugo** | JSON API | Chroma | Shortcodes/JS | High | Medium-High |\n| **Jekyll** | Generators | Rouge | Liquid/JS | High | Medium-High |\n| **VitePress** | Custom | Shiki | Vue components | Medium | Medium |\n| **Astro** | Custom | Shiki | Island components | High | Medium |\n| **SvelteKit** | Custom | Custom | Svelte components | High | High |\n| **doc-gen4** | Native | Native | Custom | Very High | Low (extend existing) |\n\n---\n\n### Key Findings\n\n#### What Works Well Currently\n- **Full control**: Custom HTML/CSS means no framework constraints\n- **SubVerso integration**: O(1) indexed highlighting is fast and precise\n- **Runway architecture**: Lean generates exactly what we need\n- **No markdown layer**: Direct Lean \u2192 HTML removes transformation step\n\n#### Framework Advantages\n- **Component reusability**: Modern frameworks have mature component ecosystems\n- **Tooling**: Hot reload, DevTools, TypeScript support\n- **Community**: Larger user base, more examples/plugins\n- **Standards**: Following conventions makes onboarding easier\n\n#### Framework Disadvantages\n- **Migration cost**: Porting all Runway HTML generation is substantial work\n- **Abstraction overhead**: Framework layers between Lean and output\n- **SubVerso preservation**: Would need to reimplement or bridge highlighting\n- **Reduced control**: Framework opinions may conflict with our needs\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations\n\n#### Option 1: Stay with Custom HTML/CSS + Incremental Improvements (Recommended)\n\n**Rationale**: Current approach works and gives maximum flexibility. Address #209 friction points without framework migration.\n\n**Improvements to consider**:\n- Better CSS organization (design tokens, variables)\n- Component-like patterns in Runway (reusable HTML generators)\n- Visual regression testing (Percy, SnapAndCompare)\n- Playwright CSS hot-swap for iteration\n\n**Pros**:\n- Low risk, incremental progress\n- Preserves SubVerso and Lean integration\n- No migration downtime\n\n**Cons**:\n- Still custom (less community support)\n- Tooling gaps remain\n\n#### Option 2: Hybrid Approach - Astro as Wrapper\n\n**Rationale**: Astro's island architecture could wrap existing Runway HTML without full rewrite.\n\n**Approach**:\n- Runway generates HTML fragments\n- Astro assembles fragments into pages\n- Interactive components (D3) as Astro islands\n- Gradual migration component-by-component\n\n**Pros**:\n- Modern tooling (Vite, hot reload)\n- Preserve existing HTML generation\n- Incremental migration path\n\n**Cons**:\n- New build layer adds complexity\n- Still need to learn/maintain Astro\n- May not solve core #209 issues\n\n#### Option 3: Extend doc-gen4 Architecture\n\n**Rationale**: Build on Lean ecosystem tooling instead of general-purpose frameworks.\n\n**Approach**:\n- Study doc-gen4 architecture\n- Add blueprint/narrative features\n- Contribute upstream or fork for SBS needs\n- Leverage Lean community work\n\n**Pros**:\n- Native Lean integration\n- Community alignment\n- May benefit other Lean users\n\n**Cons**:\n- doc-gen4 is API-doc focused, not narrative\n- Small developer community\n- Still need custom work\n\n#### Option 4: Framework Migration (Not Recommended Currently)\n\n**Rationale**: Full migration to Docusaurus/VitePress/etc.\n\n**Why not now**:\n- High cost (weeks of work)\n- Uncertain benefits for #209 friction\n- Risks breaking SubVerso highlighting\n- Loses Lean-native generation advantage\n\n**When to reconsider**:\n- If custom HTML becomes unmaintainable\n- If we need features only frameworks provide\n- If Runway complexity outgrows benefits\n- If community moves to standard tooling\n\n---\n\n### Concrete Next Steps\n\n1. **Solve #209 first** - Address design communication friction with current stack\n2. **Prototype Astro wrapper** - Test if hybrid approach adds value without full rewrite\n3. **Study doc-gen4** - Understand if extending Lean ecosystem tools is viable\n4. **Defer full migration** - Only consider if incremental improvements fail\n\nThe current custom approach is defensible and may be optimal for our specific constraints (Lean-driven generation, SubVerso highlighting, D3 graphs). Framework adoption should be need-driven, not cargo-culting.\n\n---\n\n**Research Sources**:\n- Docusaurus: https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks\n- Sphinx: https://satisfyhost.com/blog/best-software-documentation-tools-open-source/\n- PreTeXt: https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/pretext-guide.pdf\n- Quarto: https://quarto.org/\n- Hugo headless CMS: https://dasroot.net/posts/2026/01/hugo-headless-cms-best-combinations-technical-blogs/\n- Jekyll plugins: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/generators/\n- VitePress migration: https://olets.dev/posts/migrate-from-vuepress-to-vitepress/\n- Astro migration: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/\n- doc-gen4: https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4\n- mathlib4 docs: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/\n- Framework comparison 2026: https://www.nucamp.co/blog/javascript-framework-trends-in-2026-what-s-new-in-react-next.js-vue-angular-and-svelte\nEOF\n)\"",

Now let me investigate issue #210 about evaluating off-the-shelf UI frameworks for SBS site generation.\n\nKey points from the issue:\n- Currently generating raw HTML/CSS from Runway (Lean code)\n- Should evaluate whether an off-the-shelf framework would be better\n- Critical constraint: must support Lean code rendering and interactive dependency graph\n- May relate to #209 if a framework provides better design tooling\n\nI should research:\n1. Static site generators that could be driven from Lean\n2. Documentation frameworks (especially for technical/academic content)\n3. Frameworks that support custom syntax highlighting\n4. How they handle interactive elements (D3.js graphs)\n5. Integration complexity with Lean code generation\n\nLet me do targeted searches.",
