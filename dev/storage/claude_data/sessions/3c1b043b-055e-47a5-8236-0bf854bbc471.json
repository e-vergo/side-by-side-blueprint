User Orchestration\n     9\u2192\n    10\u2192User provided exceptionally clear direction throughout. Key moments:\n    11\u2192\n    12\u21921. **Issue folding:** User directed folding #96 (sbs_issue_log tool) into the #105/#107 task when it became apparent they were complementary. This eliminated a separate task cycle and reduced overall session overhead.\n    13\u2192\n    14\u21922. **Multiagent definition clarity:** User explicitly asked for comprehensive multiagent behavior definitions in CLAUDE.md -- not just the concurrency numbers, but the full behavioral contract (collision avoidance, archive state consistency, file scope isolation). This resulted in a more thorough specification than the original issue descriptions suggested.\n    15\u2192\n    16\u21923. **Wave structure approval:** User approved the 2-wave plan (Wave 1: MCP tool in fork, Wave 2: 4 parallel doc agents) without modification. The clean separation between code changes (Wave 1) and config-only changes (Wave 2) was well-suited to this split.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192**Pattern identified:** When multiple issues share a logical dependency (tool must exist before docs reference it), the user prefers consolidating into a single task over sequential task cycles.\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192Alignment was efficient. The orchestrator correctly identified:\n    23\u2192- Wave 1 needed to complete before Wave 2 (because Wave 2 agents would reference `sbs_issue_log` in their documentation)\n    24\u2192- Wave 2 could run 4 agents in parallel since each targeted non-overlapping files\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192One alignment gap: the orchestrator did not anticipate that Wave 2 agents would try to use `sbs_issue_log` (which was committed to the fork but not yet visible to the running MCP server). Two of the four agents used `sbs_issue_create` instead, which the orchestrator caught and corrected. This is a systemic issue -- MCP tools in the fork aren't available until the server restarts.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Lesson:** When a task adds a new MCP tool, agents in the same session cannot use that tool. Plans should explicitly note this constraint and direct agents to use fallback tools.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192## 3. System Design\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192- **MCP tool design:** `sbs_issue_log` auto-populates archive context (active skill, substate, recent tags, recent entry IDs) into the issue body. This reduces the manual context agents need to provide when logging bugs. The tool also auto-adds `ai-authored` and `origin:agent` labels.\n    33\u2192- **Test infrastructure:** 630/630 evergreen tests passed at both gate checks (post-Wave-1 and post-Wave-2).\n    34\u2192- **PR workflow:** PR #108 created during planning, merged at finalization. All 3 issues (#96, #105, #107) closed on merge.\n    35\u2192- **Submodule handling:** Wave 1 committed directly to the sbs-lsp-mcp fork. The parent repo pointer update was handled by `ensure_porcelain()` during archive upload.\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192The 2-wave plan executed cleanly:\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192**Wave 1 (single agent):** Created `sbs_issue_log` MCP tool in `forks/sbs-lsp-mcp/`. Added `IssueLogResult` model, implemented tool with archive context auto-population, committed and pushed to fork.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192**Wave 2 (4 parallel agents):**\n    44\u2192- Agent A: Updated CLAUDE.md (orchestration model, multiagent definitions)\n    45\u2192- Agent B: Updated sbs-developer.md (oracle-first mandate, concurrency rules, autonomous logging)\n    46\u2192- Agent C: Updated task/SKILL.md (concurrency in all phases)\n    47\u2192- Agent D: Updated self-improve/SKILL.md (concurrency, sbs_issue_log preference)\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192All 4 agents completed without file conflicts. The 2-of-4 `sbs_issue_create` fallback was cosmetically suboptimal but functionally correct -- the issues were logged successfully, just without the auto-populated archive context.\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    52\u2192\n    53\u21921. **New MCP tool availability lag:** Tools committed to the fork are not available until the MCP server process restarts. This session exposed the gap: agents documented `sbs_issue_log` as a preference but couldn't actually use it. Future plans for MCP tool additions should include a \"restart MCP server\" step between waves, or explicitly note the unavailability.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u21922. **4-agent parallelism worked well for config-only changes:** When all changes are to non-overlapping markdown/config files, 4 parallel agents provide genuine speedup with no collision risk. This validates the extension of multi-agent concurrency beyond just execution phase.\n    56\u2192\n    57\u21923. **Issue consolidation saved a full task cycle:** Folding #96 into #105/#107 avoided a separate alignment-planning-ex",

Details session retrospective analysis with 5 analysis dimensions (User Orchestration, Claude Alignment, System Design, Plan Execution, Meta-Observations). Currently creates standalone markdown files in `dev/storage/archive/retrospectives/<entry-id>.md`\\n   - **Updates needed if adding retrospective review:** YES - this is where retrospective review currently happens in the workflow. Changes to self-improve discovery would need to be coordinated with this skill's retrospective substate\\n   - **Updates needed if adding summary document to archive phase:** YES - the archive-upload substate could incorporate the self-improve summary\\n\\n### Planning and Architecture Documents\\n\\n3. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/markdowns/permanent/SLS_PLANNING.md`**\\n   - **What it says:** Describes the Strange Loop Station (SLS) framework with core principles, four pillars concept, the self-improvement loop (Work \\u2192 Archive \\u2192 Analyze \\u2192 Improve), meta loop for improving the self-improvement process, and architecture overview\\n   - **Updates needed:** YES - documents the fundamental concept of self-improve; any changes to phases or pillars would need reflection here\\n\\n4. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/markdowns/permanent/SLS_EXTENSION.md`**\\n   - **What it says:** VSCode extension spec including UI for `/self-improve` with pillar badges and finding cards. References self-improve as one of the four skill buttons with Gold color. Shows \\\"Self-improve\\\" in the control plane section\\n   - **Updates needed:** YES - if UI modifiers for self-improve change (e.g., adding retrospective review indicator), extension spec needs updating\\n\\n5. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/markdowns/permanent/Archive_Orchestration_and_Agent_Harmony.md`**\\n   - **What it says:** Describes archive as state machine and context provider. Documents skill substates including `/self-improve` phases (discovery, selection, dialogue, logging, archive) in the state transition diagram\\n   - **Updates needed:** YES - if phases are renamed or new phases added, the state machine diagram needs updating\\n\\n6. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/CLAUDE.md`**\\n   - **What it says:** Project instructions referencing `/self-improve` skill and agent concurrency (\\\"Up to 4 concurrent `sbs-developer` agents during ALL phases of `/task` and during `/self-improve`\\\"). Lists the four pillars framework and references the skill definition\\n   - **Updates needed:** MAYBE - only if architectural concurrency rules for self-improve change\\n\\n7. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/markdowns/living/README.md`**\\n   - **What it says:** References agent concurrency rules for `/self-improve`. Mentions \\\"up to 4 concurrent `sbs-developer` agents in any `/task` phase or `/self-improve` when the orchestrator determines work is parallelizable\\\"\\n   - **Updates needed:** MAYBE - only if concurrency rules change\\n\\n### Python Implementation Files\\n\\n8. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/forks/sbs-lsp-mcp/src/sbs_lsp_mcp/sbs_self_improve.py`**\\n   - **What it says:** Python implementations of self-improve MCP tools. Defines `SKILL_PHASE_ORDERS` dict with self-improve phases: `[\\\"discovery\\\", \\\"selection\\\", \\\"dialogue\\\", \\\"logging\\\", \\\"archive\\\"]`. Contains helper functions for session grouping and phase transition detection\\n   - **Updates needed:** YES - if phases are renamed or new phases added, this phase order dict must be updated\\n\\n9. **`/Users/eric/GitHub/Side-By-Side-Blueprint/dev/scripts/sbs/tests/pytest/test_self_improve.py`**\\n   - **What it says:** Comprehensive test suite for self-improve skill.

Clicking a button is equivalent to typing `/log`, `/task`, `/self-improve`, or `/update-and-archive` in a Claude Code terminal -- but with a visual identity (color, layout modifiers) that reflects the active skill.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192---\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192## Structural Enforcement\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192The extension doesn't just display the SLS workflow -- it structurally enforces it. Several principles from [SLS_PLANNING.md](SLS_PLANNING.md) that depend on convention in the terminal become properties of the interface in the extension:\n    23\u2192\n    24\u2192**Alignment through structure.** SLS's primary principle is that alignment is \"actively constructed and maintained through every interaction.\" In the terminal, this depends on the agent reading CLAUDE.md and following skill protocols. The extension achieves it spatially: you cannot start interacting without first declaring intent via a skill button. The dialogue begins pre-aligned. The skill choice IS the alignment step.\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192**Loop visibility.** The fundamental cycle (Work -> Archive -> Analyze -> Improve) is described textually in the planning doc. In the extension, the four buttons encode it spatially: Task -> End Epoch -> Self-improve -> back to Task. A new user doesn't need to read the planning doc to discover the rhythm -- the UI is the rhythm.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192**Single-agent as physical constraint.** One chat zone. One border color. One state indicator. You can't accidentally open a second terminal and start a conflicting session. The \"One Working Agent at a Time\" architectural invariant stops being a rule and becomes a property of the interface.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Transparency becomes ambient.** The archive plane is always visible. Every entry stacks up in front of you. Epoch boundaries are visual dividers. You can't avoid seeing the accumulation of structured data. The \"no hidden state\" principle holds without any effort from the user.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Introspection promoted to peer status.** Self-improve sits at the same visual level as Task. Not buried in documentation, not a slash command you have to remember exists. Reflection is a first-class activity, not an afterthought.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192**Verification rendered.** Phase indicators (task phase bar, update-and-archive substates) make gate enforcement visible. In the terminal, gates are invisible until they block you. In the extension, you watch yourself move through alignment -> planning -> execution -> finalization. The structure of the work is rendered, not just the work itself.\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**Data generation automatic.** Every interaction through the extension flows through a skill, producing structured archive data. In raw Claude Code, a user can just chat without invoking skills, producing no structured entries. The extension makes the unstructured path the exception rather than the default.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192**Escape hatch preserves flexibility.** Users can always drop into raw Claude Code for unconstrained interaction. The extension provides structure for the common case without caging power users. This is the Flexibility principle (\"configuration over convention\") made literal: the UI is the configuration, the terminal is the convention.\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192The net effect: the extension transforms SLS from a discipline (follow these conventions, run these commands, maintain this rhythm) into an environment (the conventions are the interface, the rhythm is the layout, the discipline is structural).\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192### Orchestration Overhead Reduction\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192Specific overhead that disappears with the extension:\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192- **Skill enforcement:** No CLAUDE.md instructions needed to ensure users invoke skills. The UI only offers skill-shaped interaction.\n    47\u2192- **Phase tracking:** No need for the agent to render phase state in text. The UI displays it natively via phase bars and substate indicators.\n    48\u2192- **Orphan prevention:** No risk of sessions that bypass archival. Every interaction flows through a skill, which flows through the archive.\n    49\u2192- **Question UX:** AskUserQuestion becomes a native UI card rather than a terminal interruption -- structured options r",

The function:\n    66\u21921. Extracts `~/.claude` session data\n    67\u21922. Creates an `ArchiveEntry`\n    68\u21923. Applies tagging rules\n    69\u21924. Saves to `archive_index.json`\n    70\u21925. Syncs to iCloud\n    71\u21926. Ensures porcelain git state\n    72\u2192\n    73\u2192No agent is involved. The agent's job is to *invoke* `build.py`, not to replicate its logic.\n    74\u2192\n    75\u2192### Hybrid Patterns\n    76\u2192\n    77\u2192Some workflows require both script logic and AI decisions. The **compliance workflow** is the canonical example:\n    78\u2192\n    79\u2192```\n    80\u2192+--------+     +-----------+     +--------+     +------------+     +--------+\n    81\u2192| Agent  | --> | sbs       | --> | Agent  | --> | sbs        | --> | Ledger |\n    82\u2192| starts |     | capture   |     | vision |     | compliance |     | update |\n    83\u2192+--------+     +-----------+     +--------+     +------------+     +--------+\n    84\u2192                   |                  |\n    85\u2192                   v                  v\n    86\u2192              Screenshots         JSON validation\n    87\u2192              (state)             (AI decision)\n    88\u2192```\n    89\u2192\n    90\u2192**Why this hybrid exists:**\n    91\u2192- Scripts don't call AI APIs (design principle)\n    92\u2192- Agents don't bypass scripts for state (design principle)\n    93\u2192- Visual validation requires AI (technical necessity)\n    94\u2192\n    95\u2192The intersection is handled by:\n    96\u21921. Script prepares work (captures screenshots, generates prompts)\n    97\u21922. Agent makes AI decisions (vision analysis)\n    98\u21923. Script (or agent) updates state (ledger)\n    99\u2192\n   100\u2192---\n   101\u2192\n   102\u2192## Three Roles of Archive\n   103\u2192\n   104\u2192The archive system serves as an **active orchestration substrate** with three distinct roles:\n   105\u2192\n   106\u2192### Role 1: Event Log\n   107\u2192\n   108\u2192The archive is an **append-only event log** with a regularized schema. Every significant event in the development process creates an entry.\n   109\u2192\n   110\u2192**Characteristics:**\n   111\u2192- Entries are immutable once created\n   112\u2192- Schema is consistent across all entry types\n   113\u2192- Source of truth for all project state\n   114\u2192- Enables reconstruction of project history\n   115\u2192\n   116\u2192**What gets logged:**\n   117\u2192- Build completions (trigger=build)\n   118\u2192- Skill invocations (trigger=skill)\n   119\u2192- Manual operations (trigger=manual)\n   120\u2192- State transitions (phase boundaries)\n   121\u2192\n   122\u2192### Role 2: State Machine\n   123\u2192\n   124\u2192The archive ",

It provides the scaffolding for humans and agentic AI to design, execute, and analyze structured feedback loops -- then improve the loops themselves.\n     6\u2192\n     7\u2192The core insight: a disciplined archive process, combined with automated tooling built around the rhythm it creates, enables the construction of extraordinarily powerful feedback loops. The archive becomes both the record and the raw material for improvement. Each cycle generates structured data that feeds the next cycle. The loops compound.\n     8\u2192\n     9\u2192This idea has surfaced repeatedly throughout the development history of the SBS project -- an emergent pattern that kept reasserting itself across different contexts. Hence the name: a strange loop, where the system's output becomes its input, and the process of improvement becomes the subject of improvement.\n    10\u2192\n    11\u2192## Principles\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192### Alignment Through Dialogue (Primary)\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192The human and the agent negotiate direction through structured conversation. Plans are proposed, questioned, revised, and approved before execution. Alignment is not assumed -- it is actively constructed and maintained through every interaction. The dialogue itself is the alignment mechanism.\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192### Supporting Values\n    18\u2192\n    19\u2192- **Transparency:** Archives are public-facing by design. Every decision, every cycle, every outcome is visible and auditable. There is no hidden state.\n    20\u2192- **Verification:** Claims are checked. Improvements are measured. Gates enforce quality thresholds before phase transitions. Trust is earned through evidence, not assertion.\n    21\u2192- **Introspection:** The system examines its own behavior. Self-improvement skills analyze past sessions, identify patterns, surface what worked and what didn't. The agent is expected to practice metacognition.\n    22\u2192- **Improvement:** The default posture is \"this can be better.\" Every cycle is an opportunity to refine not just the work product but the process that produced it.\n    23\u2192- **Generality:** The framework imposes no domain. Self-improvement loops for software, writing, research, operations, learning -- the archive and skill machinery is domain-agnostic.\n    24\u2192- **Flexibility:** The framework adapts to the user. Configuration over convention. Pluggable validators, configurable quality dimensions, extensible skill definitions.\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192### One Working Agent at a Time (Architectural Invariant)\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192A single implementation agent executes at any given moment. This is not a limitation -- it is a deliberate design choice that provides:\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192- **Oversight:** The orchestrator (human or top-level chat) always knows what is happening and can intervene\n    31\u2192- **Collision avoidance:** No conflicting edits, no merge conflicts between parallel agents, no race conditions on shared state\n    32\u2192- **Traceability:** Every change maps to exactly one agent invocation with a clear scope and mandate\n    33\u2192- **Debuggability:** When something goes wrong, there is exactly one place to look\n    34\u2192- **Archive coherence:** Each archive entry corresponds to a single, well-defined unit of work\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192Read-only exploration agents may run in parallel for research and context gathering. But writes are serialized through the single implementation agent.\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192---\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192## What SLS Is\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192A starter repository that provides:\n    43\u2192\n    44\u21921. **An archive system** -- Structured entries, epochs, state machine, auto-tagging, session data extraction, and gate validation. The archive is the backbone: it records what happened, enables analysis of what worked, and feeds forward into future cycles.\n    45\u2192\n    46\u21922. **A skill system** -- Phase-based workflows with state machine transitions. Ships with four core skills:\n    47\u2192   - `/task` -- Structured task execution (alignment -> planning -> execution -> finalization -> archive)\n    48\u2192   - `/self-improve` -- Recursive analysis of past sessions to surface improvement opportunities\n    49\u2192   - `/log` -- Quick capture of bugs, features, and ideas to GitHub Issues\n    50\u2192   - `/update-and-archive` -- Epoch-closing documentation refresh and porcelain state\n    51\u2192\n    52\u21923. **An orchestration model** -- CLAUDE.md + agent definitions that encode the single-agent architecture, user preferences, and project conventions. The orchestrator coordinates; agents implement.\n    53\u2192\n    54\u21924. **A CLI** -- Command-line tooling for archive management, status monitoring, testing, and oracle compilation. The interface through which humans interact with the archive outside of agent sessions.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u21925. **An MCP server** -- Machine-callable tools for skill state management, archive queries, self-improvement analysis, GitHub integration, an",

Tool Development\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192A coherent, compact, and dedicated environment for developing the **Side-by-Side Blueprint tool** itself:\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192- **SubVerso** - Syntax highlighting with O(1) indexed lookups\n    21\u2192- **Verso** - Document framework with SBSBlueprint/VersoPaper genres\n    22\u2192- **LeanArchitect** - `@[blueprint]` attribute with 8 metadata + 3 status options\n    23\u2192- **Dress** - Artifact generation, graph layout, validation\n    24\u2192- **Runway** - Site generator, dashboard, paper/PDF\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192### 2. Meta-Tooling Development\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192The active development environment for **agentic and project-specific development tools**:\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192- **Archive system** - Event log, state machine, context provider\n    31\u2192- **Validators** - T1-T8 quality scoring, visual compliance\n    32\u2192- **MCP tools** - Lean LSP integration via sbs-lsp-mcp (62 tools: 18 Lean + 41 SBS + 3 Zulip)\n    33\u2192- **Skills** - `/task`, `/update-and-archive` workflow definitions\n    34\u2192- **Agents** - `sbs-developer`, `sbs-oracle` agent specifications\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192---\n    37\u2192\n    38\u2192## Why This Matters for Agents\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192Agents working in this codebase are simultaneously:\n    41\u2192\n    42\u21921. **Building the product** (SBS tool)\n    43\u21922. **Building the tools that build the product** (archive system, validators, MCP tools)\n    44\u21923. **Being tracked by the tools they're building** (strange loops)\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192This recursive structure is intentional.\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The archive system that tracks your work is itself being developed in this repo. The validators that check your output are themselves subjects of validation. The MCP tools you'll use were built by previous agents whose work was tracked by those same tools.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192### Implications\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192- Changes to meta-tooling affect future agents (including future versions of yourself)\n    53\u2192- The archive is the source of truth for project state - treat it as such\n    54\u2192- Quality scoring applies to both product and meta-tooling work\n    55\u2192- Context injection means you benefit from what previous agents learned\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192### Agent Concurrency\n    58\u2192- Up to 4 concurrent `sbs-developer` agents in any `/task` phase or `/self-improve` when the orchestrator determines work is parallelizable with non-overlapping file scopes\n    59\u2192- Multiple read-only exploration agents may run in parallel at all times\n    60\u2192- Archive state consistency enforced: single writer for state transitions, no race conditions on ledgers\n    61\u2192- Collision avoidance is the orchestrator's responsibility via file-scope isolation in plans\n    62\u2192\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192---\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192## What This Means in Practice\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192### Use `/task` for Comprehensive Data Collection\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192All significant development work should go through the `/task` skill. This ensures:\n    71\u2192- Your work is tracked in the archive\n    72\u2192- Quality metrics are captured\n    73\u2192- Context is available for future agents\n    74\u2192- Epochs provide natural checkpoints\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192### The Archive Is the Source of Truth\n    77\u2192\n    78\u2192The archive tracks:\n    79\u2192- What skill is currently active (`global_state`)\n    80\u2192- What phase you're in (`substate`)\n    81\u2192- What happened since the last epoch (`entries`)\n    82\u2192- Aggregate metrics (`epoch_summary`)\n    83\u2192- Allows for meaningful and powerful data collection (crucial for long term analysis and introspection)\n    84\u2192\n    85\u2192When in doubt about project state, the archive knows.\n    86\u2192\n    87\u2192### Changes to Meta-Tooling Are High-Impact\n    88\u2192\n    89\u2192When you modify:\n    90\u2192- Archive system (`dev/scripts/sbs/archive/`)\n    91\u2192- Validators (`dev/scripts/sbs/tests/validators/`)\n    92\u2192- Skills (`.claude/skills/`)\n    93\u2192- Agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`)\n    94\u2192\n    95\u2192You are changing the environment for all future work. Think carefully.\n    96\u2192\n    97\u2192### Agent Concurrency Is Architectural\n    98\u2192\n    99\u2192Controlled parallelism across all workflow phases:\n   100\u2192- Up to 4 concurrent `sbs-developer` agents when the orchestrator ensures non-overlapping file scopes\n   101\u2192- Archive state remains consistent (single writer at a time for state transitions)\n   102\u2192- No race conditions on ledgers\n   103\u2192- Context injection works reliably\n   104\u2192- Applies to all `/task` phases (alignment, planning, execution, finalization) and `/self-improve`\n   105\u2192\n   106\u2192---\n   107\u2192\n ",

List files in `dev/storage/archive/retrospectives/` that are newer than the last self-improve cycle\n   - Use `sbs_entries_since_self_improve` to find the timestamp boundary\n   - Read each retrospective file (they are markdown documents with 5 analysis dimensions)\n2. Extract observations, patterns, and specific examples from each retrospective\n3. Note recurring themes across multiple retrospectives -- these are high-signal findings\n4. Identify items that retrospectives flagged but MCP analysis tools would not surface (e.g., user answer patterns, question quality, alignment gaps observed in-the-moment)\n\nThe retrospectives contain observations captured while context was hot -- things that automated analysis of archive metadata cannot reconstruct. Treat them as the highest-fidelity input available.\n\n**Step 1: Automated Analysis**\n\n5. Query recent archive entries via `sbs_search_entries` or `sbs_epoch_summary`\n6.

L2 reads all L1 documents since the last self-improve cycle. A future L3 would read all L2 documents since the last L3 cycle.\n\n**Why this matters:** Single-session retrospectives (L1) capture observations while context is hot but cannot see cross-session patterns. The self-improvement summary (L2) synthesizes across sessions and can identify trends invisible to any single retrospective -- e.g., \"the user has answered the same type of question 5 times across 3 sessions, suggesting a documentation gap.\"\n\nAs the project grows, higher levels emerge naturally. The hierarchical structure ensures each level adds genuine observational power rather than just repeating lower-level findings.\n\n---\n\n## Tool Inventory"

User Orchestration\n    12\u2192\n    13\u2192### Decision Velocity\n    14\u2192\n    15\u2192The user answered all 5 alignment questions (15 sub-questions) decisively, with zero hesitation or ambiguity. Every multiple-choice answer was a single clear selection. This is notable because the questions were genuinely complex -- cluster strategy, tag migration approach, retrospective scope, gate enforcement layers, and optimization depth.\n    16\u2192\n    17\u2192**Pattern:** The user answered 13/15 questions by selecting a pre-offered option. On 2 questions, the user chose \"Other\" and provided substantive custom text:\n    18\u2192\n    19\u21921. **Retrospective agent scope:** User specified that the retrospective should \"capture the content from our hot discussion into a markdown that a future self-improve agent can use\" -- this defined the retrospective's purpose more precisely than any pre-offered option could have.\n    20\u2192\n    21\u21922. **Update-and-archive design principle:** User stated it should be \"designed as single-agent coordination, not multi-agent orchestration\" -- this architectural constraint shaped the entire SKILL.md rewrite.\n    22\u2192\n    23\u2192**Implication for future sessions:** The \"Other\" option with free text was used exactly when the pre-offered options didn't capture a nuance the user cared about. This validates the question design pattern: offer 3-4 well-considered options plus \"Other\" for escape hatch.\n    24\u2192\n    25\u2192### Zero Corrections\n    26\u2192\n    27\u2192The user never pushed back on any agent output, never asked for rework, and approved the plan on first presentation. This suggests:\n    28\u2192- Alignment questions effectively captured intent\n    29\u2192- The plan decomposition was well-calibrated\n    30\u2192- Agent execution matched expectations\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192### Efficiency Observation\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192The user's question answers consistently favored the most ambitious/comprehensive option when asked about scope:\n    35\u2192- \"Parallel clusters\" over sequential\n    36\u2192- \"Full retrospective agent\" over summary-only\n    37\u2192- \"Both-layer enforcement\" over single-layer\n    38\u2192- \"Full optimization\" over conservative\n    39\u2192\n    40\u2192**Inference:** When the user is confident in the system's capability, they push for maximum coverage. The alignment phase should bias toward offering comprehensive options first.\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192---\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    45\u2192\n    46\u2192### Successful Pre-emptive Structuring\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The orchestrator correctly decomposed the 10 issues into 3 execution waves based on dependency analysis:\n    49\u2192- Wave 1: Foundation (#85 tag rules, #87 taxonomy, #88 state machine, #91 validator, #92 tag replacement) -- these had no inter-dependencies and could be implemented together\n    50\u2192- Wave 2: Integration (#86 phase ordering, #90 auto-validators) -- depended on Wave 1's state machine and tag infrastructure\n    51\u2192- Wave 3: Documentation (#84 /update-and-archive, #89 retrospective, #93 /task gates) -- depended on everything above being implemented\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192This ordering was validated by execution: no wave required backtracking to modify earlier wave output.\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192### Explore Agent Strategy\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192Three parallel Explore agents were spawned for discovery before planning:\n    58\u21921. Agent 1: Current tagging infrastructure, archive state, MCP tools\n    59\u21922. Agent 2: SKILL.md files, test infrastructure\n    60\u21923. Agent 3: Issue details, cross-references\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192This 3-agent parallel exploration completed faster than sequential exploration would have, and the Plan agent that consumed their outputs produced a plan approved on first try. The exploration scope was well-calibrated -- no agent returned irrelevant data, and no critical context was missed.\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192### No Misunderstandings\n    65\u2192\n    66\u2192No instance where Claude misunderstood user intent was observed. This is partly attributable to thorough alignment questioning, and partly to the fact that the 10 issues were well-specified with clear acceptance criteria.\n    67\u2192\n    68\u2192---\n    69\u2192\n    70\u2192## 3. System Design\n    71\u2192\n    72\u2192### MCP Tool Coverage\n    73\u2192\n    74\u2192The session exposed one gap: there was no `sbs_skill_fail` tool for marking skill failure with error context. Wave 2 added this tool to the MCP server. The tool was needed because previously, skill failure required manual state cleanup -- calling `sbs_skill_end` which semantically means \"success\" when the actual outcome was failure.\n    75\u2192\n    76\u2192### Phase Ordering Enforcement\n    77\u2192\n    78\u2192A significant design decision: phase ordering is now enforced at TWO layers:\n    79\u2192\n    80\u21921. **Server-side (MCP):** `sbs_skill_transition` validate",

User Orchestration\n     7\u2192\n     8\u2192**Pattern Recognition:** The user was in active \"doing mode\" from alignment completion through execution. Evidence:\n     9\u2192- User rejected agent spawn (\"I'll just make the edits myself\")\n    10\u2192- User made direct file edits in VSCode (Runway/Config.lean, Theme.lean, common.css)\n    11\u2192- User cut short finalization question (\"yes please close everything and push\") -- wanted velocity, not detailed confirmation\n    12\u2192- VSCode restart created a timing hiccup but user recovered cleanly\n    13\u2192\n    14\u2192**Assessment:** The orchestrator misread the user's mode at spawn decision. The user had already consumed the plan, understood the scope, and wanted to move. The agent spawn was a friction point, not a help. The subsequent edits (Config.lean, Theme.lean) were user-driven; the agent was never needed for execution.\n    15\u2192\n    16\u2192**Lesson:** \"Doing mode detection\" (3+ Bash calls in sequence) should trigger much earlier in the conversation, and agent spawning should require explicit user agreement when the user is already executing. The orchestrator should monitor user throughput velocity and defer to user control when it's high.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192**Alignment Effectiveness:** The 3 AskUserQuestion rounds covered critical ambiguities comprehensively:\n    21\u21921. Verso involvement (decision: CSS-only fix, no Verso changes needed)\n    22\u21922. Contrast scope (decision: light mode only, active state only)\n    23\u21923. Paper link style (decision: simple external link, no modal complexity)\n    24\u21924. External link styling (decision: consistent with blueprint links)\n    25\u21925. Section header presentation (decision: styled like chapter titles, not external links)\n    26\u21926. URL config approach (decision: add to Config.lean as faqUrl/zulipUrl)\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192All questions resolved ambiguity without over-asking. No clarification was needed during planning or execution.\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192**Root Cause Analysis:** The identification of CSS specificity bug (`.toc ul .sidebar-item` at 0,2,1 beating `.sidebar-item.active` at 0,2,0) was accurate and confirmed by user. Plan correctly targeted the specificity layer as the fix point.\n    31\u2192\n    32\u2192**Misalignment:** The agent spawn at execution was premature. The orchestrator should have recognized that the user wanted to edit directly, not delegate. This is a meta-level misread, not a domain misread.\n    33\u2192\n    34\u2192## 3. System Design\n    35\u2192\n    36\u2192**Validator Integration:** T6 (CSS Variable Coverage) validator caught a real problem:\n    37\u2192- First run: 88.2% coverage (hardcoded colors in new sidebar styles)\n    38\u2192- Root cause: new `.external-link-section` and related styles used `color: #20B2AA` directly\n    39\u2192- Fix: converted to CSS variables (`var(--status-ready)`)\n    40\u2192- Second run: 91.9% coverage (acceptable threshold)\n    41\u2192\n    42\u2192The validator correctly identified hardcoded hex values and prevented incomplete CSS variable adoption. This is exactly what T6 should do.\n    43\u2192\n    44\u2192**Build Pipeline:**\n    45\u2192- SBS-Test rebuild + capture: ~3.5 min (reasonable)\n    46\u2192- Two-commit submodule workflow (commit Runway, commit dress-blueprint-action submodule pointer in parent): executed cleanly\n    47\u2192- No build failures or cache issues\n    48\u2192\n    49\u2192**Git Workflow:** The submodule pointer update was handled correctly:\n    50\u21921. dress-blueprint-action changes committed and pushed in submodule\n    51\u21922. Parent repo detected new commit (modified pointer)\n    52\u21923. Parent repo committed pointer update\n    53\u21924. No conflicts or dangling references\n    54\u2192\n    55\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    56\u2192\n    57\u2192**Plan Fidelity:** The approved plan was followed closely:\n    58\u21921. Add Config fields (faqUrl, zulipUrl) -- executed\n    59\u21922. Restructure renderSidebar (external links section) -- executed\n    60\u21923. CSS fix for contrast specificity -- executed\n    61\u21924. CSS variables for new styles -- executed (unplanned iteration)\n    62\u21925. Build/test cycle -- executed\n    63\u21926. Close issues and merge PR -- executed\n    64\u2192\n    65\u2192**Unplanned Gate:** T6 validator failure required a second CSS pass. This was not in the original plan but was necessary to meet quality gates. User chose the straightforward fix (add CSS variables) over workarounds. The iteration added ~15 min but was resolved cleanly.\n    66\u2192\n    67\u2192**Issue Closure:** User closed #69 and #70 via the final confirmation. PR #100 merged (squash strategy) cleanly.\n    68\u2192\n    69\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    70\u2192\n    71\u2192**Doing Mode Detection Failure:** The orchestrator should have recognized user autonomy earlier. The conversation flow was:\n    72\u21921. Alignment questions (appropriate)\n    73\u21922. Plan presented ",

User Orchestration\n     9\u2192\n    10\u2192Exceptionally efficient. User provided a single, precise directive (\"just max concurrency of 4\") that simultaneously answered all four alignment questions:\n    11\u2192- Scope: Update orchestration rules only\n    12\u2192- Granularity: Config-level changes, no implementation\n    13\u2192- Safety: Max 4 concurrent agents (prevents cascade failures)\n    14\u2192- Validation timing: Standard gate (evergreen tests before merge)\n    15\u2192\n    16\u2192No clarifications needed.

Claude Alignment\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192Initial alignment questions were well-structured and elicited the necessary information in one exchange. The plan correctly understood:\n    21\u2192- Issue #101 was requesting relaxation of the single-agent constraint\n    22\u2192- The constraint only applies during execution phase (alignment/planning/finalization maintain single-agent behavior)\n    23\u2192- Parallel execution within execution phase is safe due to task-driven scope isolation\n    24\u2192- Max concurrency of 4 provides a reasonable safety boundary\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192No misunderstandings occurred. The user's terse response (\"just max concurrency of 4\") was sufficient because the plan had already been articulated clearly during alignment.\n    27\u2192\n    28\u2192## 3. System Design\n    29\u2192\n    30\u2192The skill machinery handled the full lifecycle without friction:\n    31\u2192- Archive state transitions (`alignment` \u2192 `planning` \u2192 `execution` \u2192 `finalization`) executed cleanly\n    32\u2192- Skill handoff from `/task` to `/update-and-archive` was atomic (no orphaned state)\n    33\u2192- Single-agent execution was sufficient for a config-only change (no merge conflicts possible)\n    34\u2192- PR automation (`sbs_pr_create` during planning, `sbs_pr_merge` during finalization) worked as designed\n    35\u2192- Issue closure (linking #101 to PR #103) preserved intent tracking\n    36\u2192\n    37\u2192Validator gates passed without incident: 630 evergreen tests, 0 failures. Grep validation confirmed no stale language referring to \"no parallel agents\" in user-facing documentation.\n    38\u2192\n    39\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192Plan was followed exactly with no mid-flight adjustments:\n    42\u2192- 6 passages across 3 files identified correctly\n    43\u2192- Single agent made all edits in one commit\n    44\u2192- Scope remained strictly config-only (no implementation changes)\n    45\u2192- Commit message linked #101 and PR #103 appropriately\n    46\u2192- All documentation updated consistently\n    47\u2192\n    48\u2192The simplicity of the scope meant no dependency ordering concerns or cross-file coordination challenges. A single agent was the right tool for this task.\n    49\u2192\n    50\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    51\u2192\n    52\u2192This task is self-referential: it modifies the orchestration rules that govern how `/task` itself executes. Implications:\n    53\u2192\n    54\u21921. **Rule Change Timing**: The update takes effect immediately upon merge. The very next `/task` invocation will operate under the new rules allowing parallel agents during execution phase. This introduces a regime shift in session behavior.\n    55\u2192\n    56\u21922. **Safety Boundary**: Max concurrency of 4 was chosen without explicit collision avoidance mechanisms in the config. The plan relied on task-driven scope isolation (each spawned agent has a narrow, non-overlapping scope). This works because agents are designed by explicit user direction during alignment phase, but future tasks should be cautious about spawning agents that touch overlapping file sets.\n    57\u2192\n    58\u21923. **Backward Compatibility**: The change is additive. Sessions that spawn only 1 agent during execution (the old pattern) continue to work identically. Existing task patterns don't break.\n    59\u2192\n    60\u21924. **Documentation Completeness**: All three files were updated consistently. The CLAUDE.md guidance principle, the /task skill definition, and the sbs-developer agent instructions all reflect the new parallel execution model. No gaps.\n    61\u2192\n    62\u2192## Key Takeaways\n    63\u2192\n    64\u2192- **User efficiency scales with clarity**: A single, precise directive enabled a complete task without back-and-forth. This is the ideal orchestration pattern.\n    65\u2192- **Config-only changes are low-friction**: No implementation complexity, fast validation gates, easy to verify via grep. Good use of `/task` for documentation updates.\n    66\u2192- **Self-referential rule changes require introspection**: A task that modifies how tasks execute warrants explicit noticing of the regime shift and its implications (though none are problematic he",

User Orchestration\n     9\u2192\n    10\u2192User was direct and efficient throughout, providing three alignment answers that clearly scoped the work. Two mid-session redirections occurred:\n    11\u2192\n    12\u21921. **Toggle approach**: Claude asked about a dedicated collapse-all button and separate dynamic vs static toggle mechanisms. User responded \"use existing highlight hooks\" and \"do not overcomplicate this,\" pointing to leanblueprint's simple pattern. This was a clear simplicity signal that Claude should have recognized earlier from the issue description itself.\n    13\u2192\n    14\u21922. **Static vs dynamic**: Claude proposed analyzing multiple toggle implementation strategies. User cut through this with a direct reference to leanblueprint's pattern -- a simple JS toggle that auto-expands on blueprint pages.\n    15\u2192\n    16\u2192**Pattern identified:** When the user references an existing implementation (\"like leanblueprint does it\"), this is a strong signal to match that pattern's simplicity level, not to engineer something more sophisticated. The user values matching proven simple patterns over novel approaches.\n    17\u2192\n    18\u2192## 2. Claude Alignment\n    19\u2192\n    20\u2192Over-engineered the toggle specification during alignment. The initial alignment questions were reasonable (3 questions covering scope, sidebar width, and toggle behavior), but the follow-up discussion about toggle mechanisms introduced unnecessary complexity. The web search for leanblueprint's implementation was low-value -- the user already knew what they wanted and described it clearly.\n    21\u2192\n    22\u2192**Lesson:** When a user says \"do not overcomplicate this,\" stop exploring alternatives and implement the simplest thing that works. The two redirections cost alignment time but were caught early enough that no implementation work was wasted.\n    23\u2192\n    24\u2192## 3. System Design\n    25\u2192\n    26\u2192- **Build pipeline:** `ensure_porcelain()` handled all git operations (submodule commits in dress-blueprint-action and Runway, parent repo pointer updates) without manual intervention.\n    27\u2192- **Test infrastructure:** 630/630 evergreen tests passed. T5 scored 100%, T6 scored 91.4%.\n    28\u2192- **Mobile `@media` removal:** Removing a `@media` query from `common.css` caused a test failure. The test checked for `@media` existence in common.css, which was fragile -- the query was moved to `blueprint.css`, but the test only looked in one file. This was resolved by moving the `@media` query back and adjusting scope.\n    29\u2192- **PR workflow:** PR #106 created during planning, merged during finalization. Issue #104 closed on merge.\n    30\u2192\n    31\u2192## 4. Plan Execution\n    32\u2192\n    33\u2192The plan was followed closely with one post-plan adjustment:\n    34\u2192- Planned changes to `blueprint.css`, `common.css`, `plastex.js`, and `Theme.lean` were all executed as specified\n    35\u2192- The `renderChapterPanel` function and `.chapter-panel` CSS were fully removed (~95 lines)\n    36\u2192- Sidebar width reduced from 25ch to 17.5ch (30% reduction)\n    37\u2192- Font size bumped from 0.875rem to 0.9375rem\n    38\u2192- JS toggle added with `data-blueprint-page` body attribute for auto-expand\n    39\u2192- One unplanned fix: mobile `@media` query adjustment to satisfy T6 validator\n    40\u2192\n    41\u2192Single-agent execution was appropriate for this task given the tight coupling between CSS changes and Lean template changes.\n    42\u2192\n    43\u2192## 5. Meta-Observations\n    44\u2192\n    45\u21921. **T6 threshold discrepancy:** T6 scored 91.4% and `passed: false` despite our plan gate being >= 0.9 (90%). The T6 validator's built-in pass threshold may be higher than 90% (possibly 95% or 100%). This is worth investigating -- if the validator's internal threshold differs from what plans specify, it creates confusion about what \"passing\" means. The plan gates and validator thresholds should be aligned or the distinction documented.\n    46\u2192\n    47\u21922. **User redirect cost:** The two redirections during alignment added ~1 exchange each. In absolute terms this is low cost, but the pattern of over-engineering toggle mechanisms is worth noting. Claude's tendency to explore design space thoroughly conflicts with user's preference for matching simple proven patterns. Future alignment should check: \"Is there an existing pattern to match?\" before proposing novel approaches.\n    48\u2192\n    49\u21923. **Cross-repo change coordination:** The tight coupling between CSS/JS (dress-blueprint-action) and Lean templates (Runway) worked well with single-agent execution. The dependency was linear: CSS changes defined the visual structure, Lean changes produced the HTML that consumed it. No merge conflicts or ordering issues.\n    50\u2192\n    51\u2192## Key Takeaways\n    52\u2192\n    53\u2192- **Match exist",

The Archive phase does mention generating a summary, but it's limited to counts of findings discovered, selected, and issues created\u2014there's no documented \"self improvement summary\" as a separate deliverable.\n\nNeither a dedicated manual review step nor a self improvement summary document appears in the current skill definition, so I need to be straightforward about this gap and ask how they'd like to proceed.",

Here's the situation:\n\n1. **Retrospectives exist in `/update-and-archive`** - Part -1 of the u&a workflow is a \"Session Retrospective\" that writes a markdown file to `dev/storage/archive/retrospectives/`. This already works and has produced 5 retrospective documents.\n\n2. **The `/self-improve` skill definition does NOT reference retrospectives or manual review.** The current self-improve skill uses only automated MCP analysis tools (sbs_user_patterns, sbs_successful_sessions, etc.) for discovery.\n\n3. **Issue #84** described adding retrospectives to u&a with the explicit note that \"During `/self-improve`, an agent reads all new retrospectives since the last self-improvement cycle, synthesizes findings, and generates actionable improvements.\"\n   \nSo the retrospectives were built but never integrated into self-improve. The skill needs to pull in all retrospectives since the last cycle as a primary input source, and the \"manual review\" aspect is likely the synthesis of those retrospectives combined with additional session data analysis. The output should be a markdown summary document stored in the archive, but the current skill definition doesn't include that either.",

      "content": "The user is describing a hierarchical introspection model:\n\n- **Level 1**: Session retrospectives (generated by `/update-and-archive`) -- per-session observations\n- **Level 2**: Self-improvement summaries (generated by `/self-improve`) -- cross-session synthesis that reads all L1 docs since last cycle\n- **Level N**: Future higher-level introspections that synthesize L2 documents\n\nThis implies:\n1. The storage should reflect this hierarchy\n2. The naming should be forward-compatible with levels beyond 2\n3. Each level reads the outputs of the level below\n\nSo the storage path should probably be something like:\n\n\n- `dev/storage/archive/introspections/L1/` (retrospectives -- currently at `retrospectives/`)\n- `dev/storage/archive/introspections/L2/` (self-improve summaries)\n- Future: `dev/storage/archive/introspections/L3/`\n\nBut the retrospectives directory already exists with files in it, so renaming now would be disruptive. I should keep `retrospectives/` as-is for now since those are L1 documents, create a new directory for L2 summaries, and document the hierarchy clearly so future refactoring is straightforward.\n\nActually, I don't need to ask for clarification\u2014the user's conceptual model is clear enough. I'll make a practical structural decision: keep `dev/storage/archive/retrospectives/` for L1, create `dev/storage/archive/summaries/` for L2 outputs from self-improve, and document the level hierarchy in SKILL.md so future levels can extend naturally. Now I'll do a full coordinated pass through the files I need to edit.",

      "content": "Now I have all the files. Let me analyze what needs to change in each:\n\n### 1. `.claude/skills/self-improve/SKILL.md` (Core changes)\n- **Discovery phase**: Add retrospective review as FIRST step before MCP tool analysis\n- **Archive phase**: Add self-improvement summary document (L2 introspection)\n- **Version bump**: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0\n- Document the introspection hierarchy concept\n\n### 2. `.claude/skills/update-and-archive/SKILL.md` (Cross-reference)\n- Part -1 already mentions \"future `/self-improve` agents need concrete data\" on line 208\n\n\n- I need to add an explicit cross-reference explaining that these retrospectives feed into `/self-improve` as L1 introspection inputs\n\n### 3. `dev/scripts/sbs/tests/pytest/test_self_improve.py` (Test coverage)\n- Add test that SKILL.md mentions \"retrospective\" in the discovery phase\n- Add test that SKILL.md mentions summary document in archive phase\n- Add test that SKILL.md mentions the introspection hierarchy\n\n### 4. `dev/markdowns/permanent/Archive_Orchestration_and_Agent_Harmony.md`\n- The state machine diagram currently doesn't show self-improve at all -- I need to integrate it into the flow to show how it consumes retrospectives and produces improvement summaries\n\n, then add a note about self-improve substates in the Skill Substates section\n\n### 5. `CLAUDE.md` - Already sufficient\n- The self-improve section adequately references the skill file without needing additional detail about retrospectives\n\n### 6. `dev/markdowns/permanent/SLS_PLANNING.md`\n- The self-improvement loop section already accurately describes the reflection step via `/self-improve`, so no changes needed there\n- The Meta Loop section actually maps well to the hierarchical introspection model the user described, so I should add a brief mention of the introspection levels there\n\n### 7-8. Other files don't need updates\n- `SLS_EXTENSION.md` and `README.md` don't require changes based on the new self-improve details\n\nNow I'm mapping out the specific edits to make.\n\n**File 1: SKILL.md** needs version bump to 1.1.0 and several additions \u2014 a retrospective review step at the start of Discovery Actions, summary document generation in Archive Actions, a new section explaining the introspection hierarchy, updated Recovery Semantics, and a Tool Inventory entry for retrospectives.\n\n**File 2: update-and-archive/SKILL.md** gets a clarification in the Methodology section noting that retrospectives function as L1 introspections consumed by self-improve.\n\n**File 3: test_self_improve.py** needs two new test cases \u2014 one verifying retrospective review appears in discovery, another checking for summary document generation in the archive phase.\n\n**File 4: Archive_** \u2014 the thinking cuts off here, but based on the pattern, this is likely another file that needs test coverage or documentation updates related to the archive functionality.\n\n**File 5: SLS_PLANNING.md** should incorporate the introspection hierarchy concept into the Meta Loop section.\n\n**Files 6-8** don't require changes since their current descriptions already align with the updated skill model.\n\nI'm going to delegate the actual edits to an sbs-developer agent since that's what the orchestrator pattern calls for, but I want to be careful about the user's warning regarding mid-workflow documentation conflicts. Let me verify I'm capturing the complete scope before handing off \u2014 particularly around the phase list structure, which the thinking started to examine but didn't finish.\n\nThe phase names themselves stay the same (discovery, archive, etc.), so the SKILL_PHASE_ORDERS in sbs_self_improve.py and all phase transition commands remain unchanged. Recovery semantics still work as before since discovery resume will re-query the archive and regenerate findings, now with the addition of re-reading retrospectives.
