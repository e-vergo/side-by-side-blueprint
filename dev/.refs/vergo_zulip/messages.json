I spent my time there designing Macs, but recently left and will be pursuing a masters in math at Queens college starting this fall. I'm excited to dive in, and learn all of the things I missed the first time around. I'm still very much at the beginning of my higher-level math journey, but it is clear to me that ITPs are the future of mathematics. \nLet's build something great.",

For instance, LLMs interacting with Lean via the lean-lsp MCP generate reasoning traces, code, error message logs, and other intermediate outputs. This means every proof attempt, strategy change, success, failure, and notation modification can be stored and inspected by both humans and other language models. I see no reason why insights extracted from these artifacts could not be used to influence how the LLM writes the final proof and what information is communicated in other domains.\nI would even argue that a mature version of this system (though none exists today) has an advantage in this regard. Humans have imperfect memories and chalkboards get erased. Everything the LLM does in this workflow is text that can be stored in a lossless, immutable, and transparent manner.",

Are there good arguments against full transparency beyond the overhead added when producing proofs?\nTerence Tao said:\n\n(this) may ameliorate some of the critiques against current AI usage practices, though this of course is not a panacea for all AI-related issues.\n\nWe are in full agreement on this point. I have spent a significant amount of time thinking about this and discussing it with mathematicians over the last few years which is why I decided to jump in. It's nice to see the conversation happening more broadly. This is one of the many challenges, both technical and not, that I do not see how to fully overcome. Moreover, I am of the opinion that we as a community have far less time to prepare for this than the mathematicians that I have spoken to think we do. The scaling laws coupled with better RL techniques are producing consistent trends that are likely to hold. Based on the fact that much larger data centers are going to be coming online in 2026 it would be foolish to assume things are not going to change, and fast.\nAs for Emily's talk/slide, I detect no sensationalism in her communication and believe she is right to be concerned.

In addition, it contains all the standard things: automatically generated documentation, a blueprint and dependency graph, an associated research paper, additional expository items, all packaged and displayed on a nice landing page. Most importantly, it is a 100%, \"Vibe-proven\" project from beginning to end per @Emily Riehl 's definition.\nIt is also completely riddled with errors. But if you squint it looks the part. It may also be trivially easy to prove given what's in Mathlib—I'm genuinely not sure. Regardless, That is not the point of this exercise. \nTo kick things off, I used GitHub Copilot to write a short Python script containing code capturing the basic idea.

I 'learn by doing' and the hope is that formalizing tiling theory will help me understand both the established results I half-understand and things I have found like the one above. That being said, it really looks like we may not have a 'one size fits all' definition. \nOne 'intermediate' result I was considering going after was the classification of frieze/wallpaper groups...",
