For instance, right now SubVerso is tagging a lot of lean text as unknown, including things that would have different styling if it were rendered in, say, live.lean-lang. \nFor example, In the 'computing types code' many of the punctuation characters, such as \"( ) : = >\" get tagged as 'unknown', meaning they all have the same styling applied via css. If we want to replicate this we would need more granularity on the classes. \nScreenshot 2026-01-08 at 1.20.45 PM.png\nScreenshot 2026-01-08 at 1.21.07 PM.png",
