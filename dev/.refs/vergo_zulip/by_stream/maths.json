For example, are you planning to formalize some of the Greenfeld-Tao papers?\n\n\nActually I was hoping you could tell me.\n\n\nTiling is a large field with a lot of activity in recent years, so it helps if you have an idea of things you're aiming to formalize. You could take almost any result from Tilings and Patterns, or from any paper in the subject since that book was written in the 1970s, for example. Some things might focus heavily on the combinatorial side (say if you wanted to formalize Berger's theorem that whether a set of Wang tiles admits a tiling is undecidable, possibly using one of the later presentations of the proof such as Robinson's). Some things might depend heavily on the geometrical and topological side (say if you wanted to formalize a proof that all topological discs that tile the plane using translated copies only can also do so with the tiles arranged in a lattice; Kenyon and others). Some things might heavily involve the computational side.\n\n\nThere are many things in this space I'm looking to formalize. Beyond verification, my intent in formalizing is to strengthen my understanding. I 'learn by doing' and the hope is that formalizing tiling theory will help me understand both the established results I half-understand and things I have found like the one above. That being said, it really looks like we may not have a ‘one size fits all’ definition. \nOne 'intermediate' result I was considering going after was the classification of frieze/wallpaper groups. After reading and thinking about it more, I'm now realizing the following: we theoretically could come up with some definition of tiling and use it in those classification theorems, but it isn't required. I bring this up because we are discussing 'how should we define tiling' and it has caused me to realize that something I thought was about tilings isn't. Is it fair to say that these theorems \"are really about the underlying symmetry groups of the space, and tiles are just a convenient way to think about them\"?",
