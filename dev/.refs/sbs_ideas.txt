Misc tasks/idea brain dump for SBS:

- Update all screencap activities to use a headless browser
- Update all build script to be written in lean, document them in verso?
- Motivation 4 deep dive, “Grand vision” document
- Expand the agent suite and/or skill suite
- Figure out how to allow you to better interact with lean through VSCode. Custom extension allowing you to view definitions, declarations, etc.? once could imagine deep integration with Claude Code extensions
- We should add an FAQ section for the repo. Split it into the tool we are actually working on, tools about the dev environment we have built, and misc. We should use our tooling to serve these FAQ’s in verso, and have a dedicated dashboard with custom interface specifically for the dev environment. This could have deep integration with our archival tools, especially if we port all that tooling from python to lean we might be able to build some incredible tooling for this repo and for Lean project development in general. Imagine 100% lean tooling for everything with a nice vs code extension, complete mcp integration, all bootstrapped and floating above the three consumer repos in a way that allows us to use the platform to work on the next version of itself a totally verified environment (imagine getting a truly verified message that we actually have proof certificates (up to some important details) that all lake interactions triggered the archival process and that relevant chat log has as well, along with badges for any arbitrary check you want. We could integrate our tagging system for the ledger and I bet we could write some pretty incredible code for verified automated tagging. Verified automated acting may be a big deal. Please orchestrate an agent to have a solo spin off session about that. Give it access to chrome via the mcp tools and let it search the web for ideas (every search requires my explicit approval), and have it search the codebase for low hanging fruit in this space. This could be a North Star for this repo effort; really the opportunities are endless when you consider the context in which it’s happening. Let’s do our homework on this one. 
- Mcp ‘last screenshot’ should deliver the actual screenshot, not the location. 




**********
Back end though Claude Code API. Make it fully integrated so it can happen in the background.Allow it to have a discussion with the backet agent via some portal?

- Claude Code/user interaction data analysis and insights:
    - Prompt gathering/stats gathering
    - Native tool use stats
    - Add ai driven analysis answering:
        - How could the user have lead things effectively and communicated better?
        - How could Claude Code have done better job understanding and aligning to the users intent and executing on specified tasks?
        - How could our tools be designed to naturally produce better outcomes via the way you can I interact with them
    - Enable this through mature archiving tooling
        - Robust and error resistant archival and ledger processes
        - Powerful, efficient, intuitive to both AI and human tagging
        - Smart, insightful, fully deterministic search built n top of the tagging system
    - Goal tool for inspiration: CLI tool arg misfires metric. 
        - Can we search through all of your token outputs for when you tried to use a one of our custom CLI tools with args, but find one where the arg you tried to call didn’t exist? 
        - The idea is that this indicates you wanted to a tool to exist, but it didn’t. That is a really clear signal for something we should try to build.
        -  What’s better is that it is omething that we can likely automate the harvesting of using out archival tooling
****************





- Need deeper integration/coordination between everything and VSCode. Code refactor, declaration information, etc. 
- Oracle use stats
- What other markdown files does Claude Code have deep integration with. Agent definition, skills definition, CLAUDE are examples
- Automated analytics and feedback pipeline
    - Inspired by repeated python python3 bash failure
    - Use the existing tooling to beed an abstract layer that allows for tools like the following:
        - Sorts though all the bash tool ball faiures and reports about patter.
