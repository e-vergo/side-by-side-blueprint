0:00
uh Leo De Moira. Um and I'll just say one thing, you know, of course, if it
0:06
weren't for Leo, we wouldn't all be here today. So, I'm very grateful for him and I'm very grateful to hear him speak. Um
0:12
I remember eight years ago when I started playing around with lean just on my own for the first time. I uh I was
0:19
just looking through the codebase and I saw an inductive predicate for the first time and it was just less than or equal
0:25
to and this I had such a hard time understanding it at the time and uh it's
0:30
just kind of a pleasure to see how far the language has come, the library has come and uh all of the great things that
0:36
have been happening as a result. So uh Leo, please take it away. Thank you very much. I mean very happy
0:42
to be here. Thank you everybody. uh uh for your love for LIN and we're
0:50
trying to push as hard as possible to make LIN even better right LIN's open source programming language systems
0:58
all the toolings implemented in LIN we are really proud of that LIN is very
1:03
extensible basically everything the build system documentation authoring tool vers the
1:11
type checker framework compiler Everything is implemented in here. LIN
1:16
has a small trusted kernel, right? The proofs can be exported
1:22
and you can check if independent kernels, right? More about that today later today. Uh uh there were many
1:31
really cool quotes in 2025 about LIN. But one we really liked at the link fro
1:37
was from Harry Golden saying that ling is not just interesting to improver but
1:42
also well designed modern programming language right
1:48
well if we could go back in time and told ourselves what's happened in 2025 I
1:55
think would not believe right there was so many good news last year right the
2:01
numbers I we try to collect some numbers like we had 12 releases
2:08
we reached 19,000 unique installations this in the last two years only uh these
2:15
are unique I mean people of course many people install multiple times uh more than 7,000 stars on Git uh hub
2:23
more than 50 courses that have been registered by the authors in the link
2:29
community websites we believe there are many more than that Just last year we had 4,000 PRs to the
2:36
main repo uh two major awards and five startups
2:42
using rights plus I mean there are many more and these are the big ones
2:48
we had many things that's remarkable last year
2:53
minds for contextures uh repo
2:59
uh two gold medal level performance performances by harmonic and by dance
3:05
that's the IMO I think few years ago people thought was even impossible to solve IMO problem
3:12
create a formal proof for them automatically uh the Galison theorem has project has
3:20
been completed the a AI uh AI math funds
3:25
also a big deal right I mean uh uh was great initially was n $9 million fund
3:31
but they doubled because so many uh great proposals
3:36
14 of them are using LIN we are very happy with that velvet has been listed
3:42
in December we have seen many others problems being solved by AI using ling
3:49
uh the new websites we know that in 2024 uh we tried uh the didn't like the
3:55
websites we tried again and now I I think we have a new website that's the
4:01
community likes and built on top of Bor right that's is
4:06
really cool the IAR institute was launched last year
4:12
is a big deal for the community right we have math lib initiative that Johan told
4:17
us about earlier today but we also have the Icon institute
4:22
NCS lib launches right it's another I think area where we're going to see lots
4:28
happening in 2026 six. Uh, LIN got two major awards last year.
4:36
One the ACMC plant programming languages software awards recognition of the impact in programming languages research
4:43
and practice and the school awards was the first paper we had on
4:50
10 years ago. I mean uh this is a test of time award for the impact of the projects. Uh
4:57
funding was great. We're very very grateful for the funding. Alex Ggo is
5:03
funding the MAF lib initiative and many developments that we I will
5:09
tell you more later today. that's improving the lit
5:14
programming uh improving the user experience right it's great to have this kind of
5:22
support uh I think the meth initiative will have a huge impact
5:28
and the extra funding with this new project we also impact everybody's using link for teaching writing books we even
5:36
envision a future where people will write papers mixing lan like tech and
5:41
using ber author this kind of paper. We already hired the full team, right? We
5:48
got the funding. People were skeptical, but we had an overwhelming number of applications and we have a really strong
5:56
team behind this new efforts. Uh, of course, all the good news I'm
6:03
going to tell you today would not be possible without the link, right? And we
6:08
have some many many of the people in his slides you know but there are surprises
6:14
people that are joining like Voytech that's he develops the the widget system
6:21
for link 4 and he'll be joining the fro in a few months right but uh I'm really
6:28
grateful for the whole team at the fro right all the progress we have has seen today would not be possible without the
6:35
passionate work of all of And yeah, I'll try to give you some
6:41
highlights, right? Some things that we deliver last year.
6:48
Uh, one big news is the new module system. It will enable faster builds,
6:55
right? I cannot imagine my life without the module system, right? For math
7:01
developers, maintainers, contributors. Now you can change a proof and you do
7:08
not have to compile all four dependencies of your file anymore. This
7:14
is night and day. You can change do strings without compiling everything.
7:19
It's really improves the build times and it's just the beginning right. I mean we
7:25
just deployed the mod cing to my li it will keep getting better and better. We
7:33
are going to have better support for definitions too coming soon.
7:38
Now also uh uh we don't have to load the proofs by default.
7:44
This has a huge impact on if you open the whole map li before this this this
7:50
feature it will take six gigabytes of your machine. Now you we get a 50%
7:57
reduction. It's only three gigabytes if you open the whole math, right? And this
8:03
is important, right? Many people like especially newcomers, they don't know
8:08
where things are stored in math li. They just say import math li. It's great. I
8:14
mean for learning is great. I do it myself all the time when I'm demoing math. I just import the whole thing and
8:21
you can demo you can demo. I mean people can keep asking things if you don't have
8:28
to remember what you import parallel elaboration I thought this was
8:35
in 2024 but no this has been released in 2025 I mean good things you take for
8:41
granted and you cannot let them go away and par parallel elaboration is one of
8:46
them right I love to see when you're using gu see things the the orange bars
8:52
I don't know if orange is the color in your setup in is orange. They moving in
8:57
parallel and recompiling everything. And on Tuesday, tomorrow, Sebastian will
9:04
tell you more about the module system, how to take full advantage of the module system
9:11
and his future plans for it. We also deliver many performance
9:18
improvements uh uh to math. It keeps getting better and better. There's one I want to
9:24
highlight today because uh it delivers a 9.7 reduction but from
9:32
this 9.7 8.1 is due to external PR a
9:37
single PR uh by your your I think he's here today he was earlier today but yeah
9:46
we're very very many thanks to him we are very grateful I mean I think the whole community benefits from use
9:53
reductions, performance improvements, scalability, right?
9:59
We're achieving many parts of the system that do not affect all users but affects
10:04
many users. For example, being able to support large inductive data types. Some
10:10
users love using large inductive data types. One example is the group by
10:16
Tobias Ger, the University of Cambridge. They have very large indu inductive data
10:22
types and now we have much better support for that for match statements with huge right uh uh match statements
10:31
and we keep improving right we want to support all users
10:38
we finally deliver the new compiler right I mean the previous one was the
10:45
one that was implemented in n 2018 for bootstrapping LIN 4, right? Uh uh uh
10:53
most parts of LIN were implemented in LE itself, but the compiler was one of them
10:58
that was still C++. We started in 2022 to implement one in
11:05
lean in late 2022, but with the fro the project was frozen and was only unfrozen
11:13
in 2025, right? H uh and we finally replaced it,
11:20
right? And this change enabled many new optimizations,
11:26
right? Not just optimizations, but also we manage to close many longstanding bug
11:32
fixes. Don't market as waiting for a new compiler, right? Uh uh and we have many
11:40
more optimizations coming, right? uh entity mind le implemented in ling by
11:46
improving the code generator we optimize every single tool that has been built on
11:51
top of link and now in the link code base basically only the kernel and
11:57
runtime implemented in C++ and this is by design right we want we don't want
12:03
the kernel to be in l itself you want it to be in a different language the kernel
12:08
we distribute with link we will talk more about I will I'll tell you more about kernels later
12:16
but let's uh let me focus a little bit on proof automation.
12:21
Last year we mentioned the video size is this verified bit blasting but her kept
12:28
improving it and now it can solve 96% of all benchmarks in SMT lip is a
12:36
repository of benchmarks right uh uh coming from bug finding
12:43
software verification hardware verification you name it and you have to
12:48
keep in mind that the fastest software can solve 99% but it's not verified. It's not
12:55
producing like a div sides and 96% is
13:00
really good right all key components implemented in verifies in link and it's
13:07
not just about the bit vectors vides now supports all finite integer types you we
13:14
support enumeration types and you have structures that contains only this the
13:20
supported types it will also be supported by BBD this And it enables people that are made
13:29
different application scenarios. These new features we have also uh elicit grinds in 2025.
13:38
You should view grind as a piece of automation that's based on such stability modelings.
13:46
Excuse me, my audio is bad. Can you hear? I think it was just some stray audio.
13:52
You're okay. Keep going. Okay. Okay. Uh you can feel this over as
14:00
imagine a a a white board, right? Where you you're putting facts that you are
14:05
learning like new equalities, inequalities and you keep merging equalities into
14:12
equivalence classes. It has closure, matching multiple
14:17
equalities, constraint propagation, multiple engines like for arithmetic,
14:23
commutative rings, associative and commutive operators. They all cooperate
14:29
on this white board. You're going to learn more about uh grind and how to use
14:36
it uh later this week. I think Kim's talk is on Friday or Thursday but later
14:42
this week Kim will uh give a talk about crimes how tell you how to use it
14:48
effectively how to use them new annotations to take maximum advantage of crimes.
14:56
uh we use the following design principles right we want support full dependent type theory right no
15:03
translation to first order logic or high order logic you want a super fast
15:08
startup time you don't have to call external tool or or download external
15:15
dependency come it works out of the box when it fails we want to have diagnostics
15:22
we keep improving them but we're already providing rich sets of information about the
15:28
internal state of grind. It should be extensible as everything we
15:33
have in in link, right? You should be able to plug your own solvers, add your
15:40
own normalizers, propagators, and so on. You don't need to have math lib
15:46
installed. Everything's configurable by type classes. Mafl is pre-allotated
15:52
preconfigured to use grind. uh this type class mechanism is what
15:58
enable us to to be able to use grind without math lies
16:06
folks tells me all they tell me all the time that's grind is great for software verification
16:12
but if you look at math lip today there almost 3,000 occurrenences of grind in
16:17
math flip and we we barely annotated as math flip it's a massive amount of work
16:24
grind is like simple right You have to annotate your libraries. If they're not
16:30
annotated, you don't get the maximum benefits.
16:36
But it will happen, right? Tooling, right? Uh
16:44
well, many many new features will uh uh
16:50
in 2025 for lake, right? remote caching, local artifact cache. This is funny
16:57
because uh uh this feature request happens during JMM last last year. We
17:05
had a dinner during J MM at the beginning of 2025 and Alex controvation and others were
17:12
telling me about this issue and now we have a local artifact cache.
17:19
We have semantic versioning, multiple version workspaces, new
17:24
targets, tommo support that many people in industry like to have to support for
17:30
their config project configuration files is all now available in lake.
17:39
The language software is another one that is for me it's impossible to
17:45
imagine to live without all these features. Right? For example, the auto
17:50
implicit inlays. I I don't even remember life without this feature. Right now you
17:57
can see exactly the auto implicits. Uh we now have supports for unknown
18:04
identifier. We have code actions for them. The go to definition of a type classes was a pain in the past, right?
18:12
You want to go to the to the definition of the instance, not to where the notation was defined and this is
18:19
available now, right? The mod module hierarchy I use all the time when I'm
18:25
refactoring my own codes. It's great to see all modules that you the hierarchy
18:31
you import and the and the hierarchy that imports you the module you are
18:37
working on is super valuable
18:42
also information about the type information when you are you're writing an application right you know what the
18:50
type of the next thing uh that's coming right this is also super valuable the gut and decorations
18:57
Yeah, uh Maringa has been keeping pushing the limits and making the user
19:04
experience better and better and we will keep doing that in 2026.
19:12
better error messages. I mean error messages they are an issue right for newcomers
19:19
and you are investing a lot on making them better right uh uh we want the
19:25
community to scale we don't want new users to keep asking the same questions
19:31
over and over again on Zulip right some error messages we selected one here that
19:37
was really cryptic when you have this
19:42
uh uh uh is often due to meta variables, right? It doesn't mean anything for a
19:48
newcomer and the new error message is much much better, right? Rob has been
19:55
working on that uh and we'll keep making it better and better. Right? We want to
20:03
get rid of the all the horrible messages. We also now have uh
20:11
mechanisms for people that's for example if someone's looking for results that's
20:17
how our except it's called in the rust world right if some user is familiar
20:23
with rust that's looking for a type called results will tell you that it's
20:29
called except in game right
20:35
language I don't know this starts library. We are almost delivering the start
20:42
library. When we set the flow, we had a vision of the components that we want to have in the standard
20:48
library. We are almost there. In 2026 is going to be complete. But in 2025
20:55
saw many many new features like iterators async primitives
21:01
range slicers very containers like hashmap tree map
21:06
they all verifies they come with a portfolio of lemas we also have grove
21:13
that's uh allows us to track library defects at scale. Marcus is going to
21:20
tell you more about this. This starts library later this week and show that
21:27
the start library is really setting a standards for how a verified library
21:33
should look like for people that care about writing verified software.
21:40
And there are many many new language features, right? We have now coindu predicates again that was a feature that
21:48
we had in l three but was lost in l four and now we have them and they're way
21:54
more powerful. Voy text going to tell you about coinduive predicates on Thursday
22:00
and tell you about you can even support mutual co-induction right and how you
22:05
can use this new feature in your projects. Another big deal is MVC gen is a
22:13
framework for monatic verification. Uh in the past you would hear people
22:18
telling us people would tell us oh this the do notation is great but it's horrible for
22:25
if you want to prove anything about your program and VCG is our answer to that
22:31
but it's a framework that makes it way more convenient to prove things about uh
22:38
code written using the do notation in Sebastian graph will tell you more
22:44
tomorrow about MBCg we now also have partial fixed points
22:51
right the partial keywords we all know but you cannot prove anything about
22:56
functions defined using partial but partial fixed points they're different right you can write possibly non
23:04
terminating functions using partial fixed points but you can reason about this code right and function induction
23:13
is another feature Now uh if you're using try question mark it will suggest
23:20
many times and a powerful combo is function induction together with grind
23:26
right websites. Yes, we have the new website.
23:34
It was built using Verso. We are very happy
23:40
uh Sophia did a great job uh uh developing the the new website using
23:45
vers. So I think the design looks great and we got a lot of positive feedback
23:52
from the community. Right.
23:57
the language uh uh uh the L language reference manual now is way better fully built on
24:05
Verso, right? Uh David Christensen also ported the
24:11
improving L and functional programming link to Verso, right? Another cool
24:17
feature is that in your doc strings you can reference the manuals.
24:22
For example, I had I met a user that was telling me, "Oh, would be great to have a manual for
24:29
grind." They said, "Well, the reference manual has a chapter." They did not know. And now in the dock stream for
24:35
grinds, we put a link to the manual and everything works.
24:41
It looks like magic, right? I mean, everything is in sync. We're notified if
24:47
something breaks. And this is super valuable, right? Using vessel in your
24:53
doc strings is something powerful and we will see we hope to see more and more
24:58
users using this feature from now on.
25:04
We also wrote a frequently asked questions. Uh uh we had this page on our
25:10
websites. Now the community is growing. There are many newcomers. There's a lot
25:15
of misunderstanding and having a FAQ is a way for us to
25:21
scale, right? We don't want to keep answering the same questions over and over again on Zulip. If you have
25:29
suggestions for things for us to include, please send us. The goal is to
25:36
uh to scale to not to avoid misinformation.
25:41
And for example, if someone is making a claim that is incorrect on social media,
25:48
one easy way to respond instead of spending several minutes writing respond, just send a link to the FAQ,
25:55
right? Oh, we have I want to focus a little bit on growth.
26:02
Uh we have many uh really good numbers
26:08
like number of repositories. We're reaching 8,000 repositories on on
26:15
GitHub, 900 just in the last quarter.
26:20
And you are seeing this kind of super linear growth in many different areas.
26:26
Another example is the number of unique installations, right? As I said, it's
26:31
more than 90,000 since the beginning of 2024
26:37
and we're really excited about that. This is just unique installations, the
26:42
information provided by the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
26:48
Of course, this not counting people that downloads from GitHub the VS Code plugin
26:55
for only people that are downloads downloading from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
27:03
Uh this is now being used in several big tech companies, AI startups, academia.
27:12
were really really pleasantly
27:24
surprises that ling is the only proof of a system appearing in a respectable
27:31
position of this ranking of programming languages by red mock right and where if
27:37
you look at this graph you are in the neighborhoods of systems like mathematica Small
27:43
Talk rights list rights. Oops, sorry. Uh, we're in
27:49
the same neighborhoods. Uh, the only other proof assistant that shows up in
27:55
this graph is and is on the bottom. It's here. I mean, they put this other
28:00
system on top of Cork, but Cork is here on the bottom, right? There's no other
28:05
system. only corkingly uh appeared on the ranking by Red Monk.
28:16
It's also impossible uh to not mention AI, right? I mean uh
28:23
and I think this paper summarizes uh many things that happened in 2025. Right
28:32
now we are seeing a paper where people open solving a open conjecture
28:39
by vibe proving right slight vibe closing but proving using shin link
28:44
together right and uh some people claim that the this uh
28:52
the solution was in the literature but people were not aware right the AI was capable of finding the solution lost
29:01
somewhere on the web in the web, right? And causing a formal proof for it,
29:07
right? It is a big deal. And it didn't stop there. Many uh uh the
29:15
AIs by many of these startups like by a logical intelligence, a math, they all
29:22
start proving open conjectures by others right in the
29:27
last few months, right? something that would not believe to be possible a few
29:34
years ago. I found funny last month someone posted,
29:40
"Oh, we solve it others problem." And someone replies on social media saying,
29:45
"Oh, it's not a big deal. This is just like a IMO problem."
29:51
Well, I mean 2019 when I don't know many of I think many of you were there when
29:57
Daniel Selson proposed the IMO grand challenge in 2019
30:02
and everybody said this was impossible. No way AI would solve IMO problem
30:10
and now people take for granted that AI can do it and they say this is a easy problem right if it's like IMO problem
30:18
but it's a good sign I mean things that people thought were impossible a few years ago now people think they are easy
30:27
and this is a trivial problem for AI and I find this really remarkable
30:35
We are very happy with all the startups. Uh I think these are the five main ones
30:42
we are aware. If I'm missing your startup, please tell us.
30:47
We know there are many more. I mean some of the venture capitalists that are funding these startups told us there
30:54
more than 20 that contact just these venture capitalists.
31:00
And it's great to have a thriving startup ecosystem.
31:06
It validates ling as a a platform of choice for verified AI reasoning and
31:12
this unstoppable right. I mean uh many of us already using AI.
31:19
Kim convinced me that AI is really powerful uh for developments and for generating
31:28
tests documenting your code reviewing I mean AI found bugs in our codes and
31:34
fixes the codes I find it's now mindblowing
31:40
and this is just the beginning you have to keep in mind this all going to keep better and better with tooling on top of
31:47
this AI Yeah, this is going to keep getting better and better, right?
31:55
CS lib, right? It's another big deal. Fabricio going to tell you more about
32:01
CES lib uh tomorrow. This is a focus effort for formalizing
32:06
computer science in l uh you should view SAS lib as math li
32:12
for computer science. uh is supported by AWS, Google deep
32:17
mind, STU and center at Stanford. You have the the goal there is to say
32:25
foundations and support for reasoning about codes to have a repository verified codes
32:31
where you have many algorithms and data structures that come with the literature formalized in lan and of course be a
32:39
platform for AI right we believe that the same way we are seeing math of AI
32:47
driving because math li exists AI for computer science and software
32:54
verification will drive if there's a library like CS Le
33:01
and we want to support all these different verification tools
33:07
building on top of L right we have velvets when I saw the demo I saw the demo last
33:14
summer I was blown away I mean when they demo it to me at PLGI
33:20
It looks great. I mean a GSL inside of L. You can write verification
33:28
verify put annotations in your code and gets verification conditions extracted automatically.
33:34
It look it's really impressive. We have now MVC
33:40
the the monatic verification framework being developed as the link flow that's seash graph will tell you more
33:46
uh uh uh tomorrow ideas for rush verification right we
33:53
have strata all these different frameworks right
33:59
we at the fro we want to ensure they all scale they all perform really well and
34:05
we de keep developing the foundation ations to ensure that this kind of project performs really well in the L
34:14
framework, right? Uh AI systems excel at generating codes.
34:22
They do it really well. But can you trust the code by link providing the missing piece,
34:28
right? A a proof that the code is correct. uh prove that your code satisfies your
34:36
specification. Well, I we have to talk about soundness,
34:43
right? Because of AI, soundness is more important than ever, right?
34:49
Because of AI now that many people claiming they solve it open conjectures.
34:56
Uh a few days ago a person contacted me saying that they did not solve one
35:01
millennium prime they solved four of them and they claim they have a proof in link rights of
35:08
these theorems it's importance right so we have to
35:14
ensure that nobody will distract the community saying oh I
35:20
have a a a fake proof of some important conjecture in mathematics
35:26
or that they verify the piece of codes that's in critical crucial
35:32
but they're exploiting something in the system right lean value proposition
35:38
rests on trust right if the gunner has bugs proof proofs mean nothing right
35:45
there many critical use cases aim competitions verifies software hardware
35:53
uh all these open conjectures that people are claiming results.
35:59
As the community writes, as the community increases in size, right, the
36:04
expectations are going to keep increasing too, right? And this is right.
36:11
We want to have good answers for these questions, right? We are taking this kind of question. How can I trust a link
36:17
proof very seriously at the LRO? We want to provide the tools, the infra infrastructure, the
36:24
documentation to ensure how our users can verify their proofs for their own
36:30
standards. We have a small trusted kernel, but one
36:36
kernel is not enough. From the beginning, the goal of the project is to have
36:42
multiple kernels. In L three, we has more.
36:47
But in L4 we still we have two extra kernels right nod implemented in rust we
36:55
have lin for l implemented in l itself and we have the link for checker that's
37:00
based on the official kernel but it's independent right l for checker ensures
37:06
that you cannot use the meta programming capabilities to exploit the system
37:13
we have export formats Right. And we strongly believe that with different
37:21
languages, different authors, different approaches, the best way to ensure our
37:27
results are correct. Right? We also have a a a new sec uh sec a full
37:37
chapter in our uh reference manual, right? talking about
37:43
how you should approach validating a link proof the guarantees you get when
37:48
you are inside of the when you use link for checker when you use nod and so on right the different
37:56
scenarios and what do you get when you verify you go through each one of these
38:03
steps we also elicit comparator right it's a
38:09
trustworthy proof Judge rights comparator is a project developed at the
38:15
link. The goal is to have a judge rights. Uh uh it's useful for
38:24
competitions where the organizers are going to have
38:31
for for each problem they are going to have they are going to curate a statement of the challenge right same
38:38
thing for open conure rights. You can have conjectures that you have
38:43
that have been curated by the community. And after you have h this reference uh
38:50
statements, right, that has been curated by experts, you can use comparator for checking if a proof or this conjecture
38:58
for this problem is correct or not. Comparator also provides a sandbox
39:04
execution has support for anoda uh and the lingu
39:09
official kernel and we we want to have support for many other kernels right
39:17
a as we said I mean we strongly believe that having many kernels is the way to
39:23
go but how to motivate people to write new kernels right well the answer is the
39:30
link Cano arena the arena.lang.org is already up. Uh we're going to be
39:38
posting more about it uh uh later on Zulip. Right. What are the goals of the
39:44
arena? Right. The arena is uh is a gamified competition for kernel
39:51
implementations. You're going to have a leaderboard there where we are going to rank the kernels,
39:58
the different kernels by completeness, soundness, performance, days, since last soundness,
40:07
lines of code, you name it, right? And you're going to have both positive
40:13
tests like you have to be able to type check math flip and it's really good.
40:20
Noda for example can verify type ret type check math li I I I bet you don't
40:26
know how fast it is with a few course you can do in five
40:31
minutes the whole meth you can do a type check using right and this is also a way
40:38
these websites a way to tell the community these others exist how fast
40:45
they are it's not more speculation saying oh I think in another is fast You
40:50
can go to the link arena and see the actual number. How long does it take?
40:56
You say we increase awareness. People you learn about new kernels or kernels
41:02
that existed and only the experts knew about them. Now you increase
41:08
transparency. We also going to collect negative tests. We want people to submit
41:15
really tricky tests, exploits and issues to make sure, for example, if people I
41:24
if some external kernel assumes some crazy L definition will never
41:31
happen like saying, oh, we're going to have only up to 255 constructors,
41:37
right? You can swim tricky exploits that try to exploit this kind of assumption
41:42
that's is not reasonable. So you're going to have a collection of
41:48
positive and negative tests. We think many people will start building because
41:53
you have an easy way to test your kernel. People will start developing new kernels. We'll try to improve the
42:00
performance especially for special situations right saying oh my go can
42:06
check Netflix 10 times faster this is valuable right and we will also be a
42:13
platform to try new ideas now someone has a question on how to implement a new
42:19
kernel they can test easily test on a massive
42:25
benchmark suite and on also trick tricky problems, right? Watch out for
42:32
our our announcement on Zulip. H the main message here is decentralized
42:39
trust. You should not trust us ever. You should verify, right? You don't need to
42:45
trust inflow. If you want to implement your own kernel, you should uh if you
42:51
want to use many external kernels, we think it's a good idea. There's no single point of failure, right? If one
42:59
kernel has a bug, other kernels can catch it. The goal should have different authors using different programming
43:05
languages, different approaches, right? And the kernel uh uh this kernel
43:12
arena will provide a common interface, a common place to test all these different
43:18
kernels, right? The goal is trust in the collective not
43:24
in a single implementation.
43:30
Moving forwards, right? I mean 2025 was an intense year for everybody
43:36
working at the front. 2026 is not going to be different. Right? We want to
43:43
finalize this library. Right? the compiler. We want the compiler to generate smaller binaries, right? We
43:51
want to improve its performance, the performance of generated codes,
43:56
benchmarking, right? We are investing on benchmarking. You probably uh many of you are probably
44:04
not aware that we have a new benchmarking infrastructure called radar is running on lean math. We have
44:13
performance data. for them and they're going to have many more benchmarks there. CS lib is there too.
44:22
uh for lake we are going to uh deploy the remote cache right for a flip pro
44:30
with automation you're going to be working not just on improving grinds but making things more scalable
44:38
try question mark will become the standard uh entry points
44:44
for sledgehammer like tools we want try question mark calling as simp grinds lm
44:53
and so on, right? And it's going to be extensible. You're going to be able to plug your own tactic to try question
44:59
mark suggestions. I mean, Kim has been working on the suggestion framework. Lyn
45:08
will come with a a a simple but effective way to suggest
45:16
theorems. Uh but it's going to be extensible too. You're going to be able to connect your
45:22
favorite AI to suggest theorems and this is useful for grinds or apply and so on,
45:29
right? And we also want to deliver counter example generation. Then Sebastian graphs work on a new do
45:37
notation. It will be fully integrated with the verification condition generator.
45:44
You should expect many improvements on usability. You're going to have the new auto for matter. This is going to be
45:52
especially for M. We hope it will accelerate the PR merch process. Nobody
45:58
will have to discuss keep enforce enforcing manually coding conventions.
46:04
They're going to be applied automatically by the auto formatter. We are going to keep improving the home
46:10
messages, polishing the interface and we want to have many case studies
46:16
showing lan performance gains not just in math but in software hardware
46:23
verification AI for math in software and so on for physics
46:30
and we have this new initiative that's the link rights where we want to enable
46:36
people in the future to write even papers, math papers using verso mix a
46:44
mixture of verso and latte. Right? We want also this plat to be a platform for
46:51
games. We want people to be able to create games without knowing anything about web programming,
46:58
right? They focus only on the content. We want to be able
47:04
we want to enable our users to deliver courses without relying on live.lang.org
47:12
right because this is not scalable if there are many users simultaneous users is going to crash our servers.
47:20
One idea is to have a very easy way for anybody to launch a server, a local
47:27
server in their department without knowing anything about technical details. Just starting a docker
47:34
container and running a server that they can teach a course with the right
47:40
version of math they wants everything preconfigured. They just don't have to
47:45
install anything on their machines. they just use the web interface
47:51
and I think will have a huge impact on education. We are also going to have verso and
47:59
blueprints integrated going to be able to use blueprints and verso together. I
48:04
think this is also going to be another big deal for the community. Yeah, these are our plans for this new
48:12
initiative softification, right? This is another area that's we're
48:19
going to see lots of activity, right? Many of these AI startups
48:26
uh they attacking math as a first it's like a first mission, right? They want
48:34
they are startups. They want to make money. They are not like the math li initiative or the link pro. They are
48:39
nonprofits. They are forprofits and they need to generate revenue. Right? One way
48:46
to generate revenue is going after software verification. Right? And all these startups are going after heads and
48:52
we have to make sure link is the best platform for verified software. Right?
48:58
That's why we are investing on the new do notation. We are also developing a call by value
49:04
tactic context sample generators finally train incrementality and
49:10
parallelism and a new framework the CM is a new framework we're developing at the throw
49:18
that will enable uh the developments of a five condition generators
49:24
these tools velvet mvcgm strata they all we can put them in a bag
49:33
called verified condition generators. They have all share
49:39
same scalability issues. Uh this new frameworks based on feedback
49:46
provided by the authors of these tools, right? uh we had a a hackathon at in the end at
49:54
the end of 2025 and we got all the feedback we needed to
50:00
push this new framework and surely is super efficient for this kind of application.
50:07
The compiler we want to focus in 2026 in smaller binaries and stability. We want
50:14
the compiler to be super stable. Right? We are going to be improving uh
50:19
derivative instances right deriving clauses we have in ling sometimes it
50:25
generates they impose a quadratic overheads if you have a big inductive
50:31
data type it is a big deal and we are fixing that right you fixes many places
50:37
but there are many to come right and there will be many new features in the
50:42
compiler to improve the performance of the code that's generated by link
50:50
ability and backward compatibility is also something it's worth investing a
50:56
few minutes right l is 12 years old but
51:01
l for is not that old right it was helized in July of 2023
51:09
mafl was sported cheuling for in July 2023 tree. Uh uh it really made my day
51:19
because was the 10th anniversary that Lyn was the first commit of Lyn that
51:25
they manage to port fully portf uh Patrick Masau had a really nice video
51:33
at the time celebrating that. But what it means that Lyn's two and a half years
51:39
old, L four, right? uh since then we had 25 releases right
51:46
and should more than 7,000 cars mergers in the main repository
51:52
many people complain about backward compatibility I think they are right we are we hearing you and we are taking the
52:01
actions to improve the current situation right
52:06
when we break backward compatibility is not because we want to we want to make
52:12
the life of our users a nightmare. But some design decisions reveal problems
52:18
only at scale. Right? For example, this quarter we are fixing a problem that's
52:23
affecting math deeply. Right? Your home, we already discussed this problem with
52:29
your home. Last quarter we promised that we would fix but it will affect some
52:36
users. K and I expecting a major battle to fix.
52:42
I mean we're going to have to fix to fix this performance issue will create problems for athlete but we will have to
52:48
fix them right will be a positive fix but it's a break of backward
52:54
compatibility. Sometimes we break because we want to to
53:00
fix a fundamental issue. We don't want to keep accumulating technical debts, right?
53:07
uh and the new features like the module system the type resolution there are fixes that
53:13
we need there to and the library there are things that's uh in the library were not good we had
53:20
to change and broke backward compatibility but this keep getting better and better
53:26
our uh as I said we're improving many different places right uh uh uh
53:36
But these fixes are necessary, right? We are building a
53:42
solid foundation. That's our goal, right? We our commitments,
53:50
our goal for 2026 is to make sure this is the last year where where we have
53:56
this kinds of uh breakage, right? from 2026
54:05
after 2020 from 2027 and beyond we want to make sure that this kind of breaking
54:12
change will not happen anymore. Right now we already
54:18
investing a lot on release notes documenting all breaking changes.
54:23
We're taking duplication annotations seriously. We will invest more efforts on mig
54:30
migration guides. We understand stability is essential for adoption and
54:36
we are working to earn your trust that things will get better and better with time.
54:43
Looking ahead, we have to keep in mind AI is transforming how is already transforming
54:51
how we do mathematics and write software. It's already changed how I write my own software, right? And I
54:59
think we have cheaper changes, but I I I became advocates because of Kim. I mean,
55:06
but after all the tricks Kim told me, I I cannot
55:11
even imagine developing software without AI anymore. And this will not stop. This is just the
55:18
beginning. We will have AI system that can discover and verify mathematics. We will be able
55:25
to verify software at scale right we are building the infrastructure of
55:32
trust with AI and verified software uh uh
55:40
I I'm really grateful for all the efforts uh uh that we are putting on
55:45
building math lib le itself and all the AIS that are
55:51
benefiting from these different libraries Uh please get involved, contribute to
55:58
new projects, start writing new documentation, lecture notes using vers right
56:05
is the future for writing lecture notes, games
56:10
and in the future even papers are going to be written using Verso report issues,
56:17
builds your own independent kernel, try to participate in the kernel arena.
56:23
I think it will be fun. Thank you a lot for your attention.
56:29
H happy to answer questions.
