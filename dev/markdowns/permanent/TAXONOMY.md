# Document Taxonomy

This document defines the classification system for documentation in the Side-by-Side Blueprint monorepo. Understanding this taxonomy is essential for maintaining documentation coherence and knowing what changes mean.

---

## Categories

### Permanent (`dev/markdowns/permanent/`)

**Definition:** Architectural bedrock. Changes to these documents signal fundamental shifts in how the project works.

**Characteristics:**
- Expected change frequency: months+
- Changes are significant events, not routine updates
- Should be stable enough that agents can rely on them
- Trigger `permanent-doc-changed` auto-tag when modified

**What belongs here:**
- Architectural decisions that won't change without major refactoring
- Orchestration patterns that define how agents work
- Classification systems (like this document)
- Core design principles

**Current contents:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TAXONOMY.md` | This document - classification system |
| `Archive_Orchestration_and_Agent_Harmony.md` | Script-agent boundary, archive roles, state machine model |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Build pipeline, component responsibilities, dependency chain |
| `GOALS.md` | Project vision, problem statement, target audience |

---

### Living (`dev/markdowns/living/`)

**Definition:** Current state, active plans, and evolving documentation. Changes are expected and normal.

**Characteristics:**
- Expected change frequency: days to weeks
- Reflects the current state of the project
- May contain plans that get completed or abandoned
- Updates are part of normal development workflow

**What belongs here:**
- Project README (public-facing overview)
- Current MVP or milestone definitions
- Active plans and roadmaps
- Status reports

**Current contents:**

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Meta-document for agents about monorepo purpose and dual nature |
| `MVP.md` | Current minimum viable product definition |

---

### Generated

**Definition:** Auto-produced from code or other sources. Never manually edited.

**Characteristics:**
- Lives at natural locations (not in `dev/markdowns/`)
- Gets overwritten by automation
- Manual edits will be lost
- Source changes trigger regeneration

**What belongs here:**
- Oracle knowledge base (`sbs-oracle.md`)
- Per-repository READMEs (auto-generated sections)
- Quality score reports
- Compliance status files

**Key generated files:**

| File | Source | Generated By |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `.claude/agents/sbs-oracle.md` | All repository READMEs | `sbs oracle compile` |
| `dev/storage/{project}/QUALITY_SCORE.md` | Validator results | Quality scoring system |
| `dev/storage/COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md` | Compliance ledger | Compliance validation |

## Semantic Meaning of Changes

Understanding what document changes mean:

| Category | Change Means | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Permanent** | "We're shifting the foundation" | Review carefully; may affect agent behavior and assumptions |
| **Living** | "We're making progress" | Normal development; update as work proceeds |
| **Generated** | "Source changed" | Informational only; regenerate if needed |

## Decision Guide

When creating or updating documentation, ask:

1. **Is this auto-generated from code?**
   - Yes -> Generated category (place at natural location, ensure regeneration pipeline exists)

2. **Will this change frequently as we make progress?**
   - Yes -> Living category (`dev/markdowns/living/`)

3. **Is this a fundamental architectural decision or pattern?**
   - Yes -> Permanent category (`dev/markdowns/permanent/`)

4. **Is this a reference for agents that should be stable?**
   - Yes -> Permanent category (agents rely on stability)

## Maintenance

This taxonomy should be stable. If you find yourself wanting to add a new category, that's a signal to pause and consider whether the existing categories can accommodate the need.

Changes to this document should be rare and deliberate.
